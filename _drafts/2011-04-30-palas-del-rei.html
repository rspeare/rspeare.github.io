So I´m here chilling with Benny about 65km from santiago. hope you like the uploaded videos. <br /> <br />A few strong feelings from the day,<br /><br />German people (men actuall) are crazy, and sometimes say very dirty things in german when they don´t think anyone understands. Not an appropriate story for the internet.<br /><br />French men love big mustaches.<br /><br />Jose Luis Zapatero, the spanish president, is a total sleezebag.<br /><br />I love maxibonn ice cream sandwiches after a long walk.<br /><br />Princeton won the penn relays 4xmile championship of america today. wow. makes me happy, and a little sad.  <br /><br />...<br /><br />3 days remain to santiago. I´ve got plenty of money and time to live up this last week in spain. Hoping to rent a bike and maybe reach the coast ahead of schedule.
