So, I¨m taking a rest today with toby and julia in Astorga. <br /><br />This town is really cool. Very small, with tons of cafes and chocolate shops. Very much a tourisy place for spaniards. Went for some coffee and donuts this morning with toby and we met a hungarian guy who was an absolute wealth of information. Toby and he talked about strange films and language, while I kind of zoned out. Went for a nice run today, feeling very strong from all the walking. Unfortunately breathing is a little harder, but these quads be strong like bull! Afterwards made some noodles and had lunch with julia and toby. Julia bought us artisan chocolate, and toby and I regrettably didn´t have the self discipline to not devour it all. NOw, just surfing the nets, wasting away the afternoon, waiting for tomorrows walk and tonights conversation. <br /><br />Life is good here in astorga, but i´m very excited to be getting close to santiago and closer to getting home. Only 260km remain to santiago and 23 days remain.<br /><br />Julia and I had risotto last night and it was pretty awesome. Being here in europe is inspiring me to watch cooking videos on youtube. Its nice to know how to make a simple but tasty pasta, rice, or lentil dish. Those foods are so cheap, healthy, and can be carried quite easily.<br /><br />By the way, when I was in Leon, met a british guy named Jim and we started talking about bike touring and the tour de france. This guy Jim lives in holland with his wife and has done the camino 4 times already. Jim is nuts, he has biked from canada to patagonia south america and back... twice. I was talking to him about my dream to bike tour in america, and he had all sorts of information. Apparently the montana and oregon areas have specific rest sites for bike tourers which sound cheap and pretty awesome. Maybe one day, i´ll get jonnie or even clarke to come along for an adventure out west. I told Jim that I didn´t want to do the bike tour trip this summer because it was simply too lonely... he had no sympathy for that. "just find someone online!". Sorry Jim, thats a bit much. To give you a little snippet of his personality, here is a retelling of one of his stories as he was trying to convince me that biking in mexico isn´t that dangerous:<br /><br />So apparently Jim when he was my age had biked south from canada and was waiting to cross the border into mexico in arizona. Many ppl were telling him how dangerous it was and all sorts of panic. Jim was quite scared and as he was sleeping in his bivvy sac and sleeping bag the night before, just next to the border, he was woken up by many flash lights and guard dogs looking for illegal immigrants. Now, once the police realized jim was white they didn´t care and left him alone to sleep. Later that night, Jim saw "the most amazing meteor shower of his life", and he took it as a sign from god that was telling him to just chill out and that everything was going to be fine. So, the next day he woke up and crossed the border. It was sweltering hot, above 100 degrees since it was september and he was really struggling about 30 miles from the border. A pick up truck pulled up next to him and looked over and saw a huge, fat, ugly mexican bearded man staring at him, opening up the car door and reaching over towards his bicycle. JIm thought, oh god, I¨m goign to die, everyone was right. And then, the big burly mexican gave him a 6 pack of cold beer and a bag of ice. Jim loved the gift and took at as a "welcome to mexico" message. He shared the beer with a friend at a local market down the road and drank the rest later that night. He described the ice as fantastic. Now later that afternoon, Jim was getting quite cold because apparently in that part of the desert the weather is quite extreme. As he setting up for the night in a small town to get into his bivvy, a family saw him and invited him to stay with them that night at their house. Jim accepted, and jumped into the back of the pickup truck with "all twelve" of the kids and rode off to their farm. They were very poor cattle farmers and so could only eat beef for dinner, which Jim loved. They set him up in the barn in a large bed of hay which was a great source of heat. Jim set up is sleeping bag and apparently two of the farm cats and the family dog came to snuggle up with him. Jim said that the dog, came right into his sleeping bag and peed on him. But Jim said "I didn´t care because it was warm". The next day he set off again on his bike, and he describes that story as anexample of one of the thousands of good stories about mexico that never make the CNN news.<br /><br />Wow, I know. Take what you want away from it; but what a story.<br /><br />Missing you guys. And don´t worry mom I´m not going to go biking in search of peeing dogs in mexico.
