<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">After attending a lecture the other night and superficially perusing the topic of "Bohmian" mechanics, I would like to cathartically expel some opinions into webspace.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Given the shortcomings of Quantum Mechanics, i.e. its inability to describe the previous nature of a particle before measurement -- examples include Schrodinger's Cat, the Two slit interference experiment and Quantum Entanglement -- many Philosopher-Scientists have gone on the war path to describe "hidden variables" and our fundamental human ignorance to God's reality. One of the proposed solutions, at least in the classical regime, is something called Bohmian Mechanics, which seems to combine the Statistical methods of Thermodynamics and Schrodinger's wave equation -- please excuse the lack of detail, I have only ablated this topic -- to create a rudimentary construct for avoiding indeterminism. The whole problem, which Bohm attempted to solve I suppose, starts with the presence of 'hidden variables' or 'unobservables' that give rise to strange physical behavior.<br /><br />&nbsp;An analogous dilemma occurred in the early 20th century, when the classical theory of Thermodynamics was making fantastic predictions; but, the advent of Blackbody radiation and certain inconsistent minutiae such as the ultraviolet catastrophe -- hardly minutiae, come to think of it -- lead to the disturbing development of Quantum observables, Quantum laws, and the new "Statistical" interpretation of Thermodynamics. Instead of relying upon macroscopic quantities such as Energy, Pressure, Volume, &amp; c., we began to describe a system's behavior in terms of Quantum Microstates and Probability distributions, accepting the possibility that we may never TRULY now the exact Quantum state of a system, we can only estimate what it's most LIKELY to be. Luckily in Thermodynamics, the scale is so incredibly large that the probability distribution for observable states in the human experience is incredibly small, precise. The "hidden variables" in this case, are the specific Quantum States of each and every particle in a system with a great many pieces -- the spins, angular momenta, principle quantum number of each and every lepton, meson, boson in the bunch. We could, for the most part accept our status as a Quantum ignoramus because we could macroscopically qualify as an experimental stud. OK fine. But what about if you want to be a "Quantum Experimental Stud" too?<br /><br />Then you run into problems.<br /><br />The hidden variables in this regime aren't so easily found, and the probability distribution is much less precise. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, position and momentum operators are much more diffuse and are in fact mutually exclusive (non-commutative is the math term). Well, that sucks. So this guy Bohm Steps in and seems to have created a strange permutation of the Boltzman factor -- a construction of relative probability by comparing the number accessible microstates in two systems -- for a single wave function. He does this by treating the "Universe" as the heat resevoir, which itself is ill-defined, and applying its presence to a very small sub-system like the wave function of an electron. This is all well and good I suppose, but it's still relative probability, it doesn't move us any further down the line. <br /><br />In this paper I just read, sitting here on a lazy Thursday afternoon, these few Philosopher-Mathematicians (I add the prefix because they use haughty latinisms like 'qua' and 'per se', 'viz' and 'a priori', 'axiom' and 'abrogation') have talked quite a bit about Bohmian mechanics and how it conserves Probability density as the square of the wave function, and how it avoids the indeterminism of Quantum Mechanics on small scales, but I feel empty after reading it. They have still not answered the question as to a specified Macrostate of the Universe at some initial time, much less assuaged the disturbing question of multiple universes and an ensemble of measurable quantities at some instant of time and space -- a fundamental concept in thermodynamics. Plus, they don't even go into relativistic Quantum Mechanics! Which, by the way, does disperse some of the indeterminism of QM (I guess) by promoting particles to fields, and allowing for strange things such as time reversal and anti-particles. Refuting this paper formally, instead of denigrating it as I am currently, would be a monumental task. I'd prefer to be callow, craven, and sit on my high horse in this plush little office chair and demur the paper by saying "this doesn't feel right" or, "I am not satisfied".<br /><br />Luckily the authors, at their very core I believe, share my sentiment. They end the paper with a Quote from the great Physicist Bell, which can be summarized as saying:<br /><br /><i>To admit our ignorance, our myopia at Quantum scales, is to adopt a measure of humility : it is not an indulgent metaphysical whim.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</i><br /><i><a href="http://galeon.hispavista.com/ignaciodarnaude/textos_diversos/Quantum%20Physics-Philosophy.pdf">Bohmian Mechanics: Quantum Mechanics Without  Quantum Philos</a></i></div>
