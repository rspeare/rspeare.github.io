----------------------------------------<br /><br />Each animal has its own habits of housekeeping: dogs and pups who play in their own mess (they survive only by pathetic appeal to caretakers); birds who meticulously construct and tamper with their nests, incessantly checking for strewn branches or missing leaves; cats, who roam with no permanent residence and drift with their one belonging--an exceedingly capable body; then there are pigs, who establish residence based upon eating habits and are the most ingenious of comfort-utility maximizers. These portly creatures allow their living space to fester beneath repeated festive, digestive and excretive activities. (Gross right? Well of course, it's pigs we're talking about.)<br /><br />But all is not lost for Piggydom, for their saving grace lies in a thorough understanding of housekeeping delegation and persuasion; they avoid neglected cleaning duties by applying a deft hand in social manipulation: compulsory guilt, outright flattery, non-existent lease references, and stubborn patience are just a few in the porcine arsenal against household responsibility. Many studies have been undertaken to close the "animal housekeeping habit gap" (AAHG), but all with disastrous results; most only serving to highlight the manipulative dexterity of pigs and the agitated-generosity of other animals. <br /><br />The most recent of the AAGH social experiments concerns one young Pig and one young Bluejay co-assigned a summer school dorm room. The results of this experiment are being carefully reviewed by the AAGH board, with recommendations being passed onto the "Stimy Housekeeping Enervation in Extravagant Specie-Habits" (SHEESH) task force.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br />It was a damp July afternoon when Bob the bird was off to his summer school boarding program in the country. He hopped along gingerly with his little clawed feet, perching and pouncing from rock to rock, enjoying his trip into the brush. The sun beat into his blue feathers and incited a few beads of sweat, but Bob always loved hopping in the summer sun. He was looking forward to his classes in this wilderness and the inherent freedom of living in isolation from bird-society. He had been assigned a random roommate for his stay in the country, a consequence of slight procrastination. His mother had scolded him back at the nest, warning of filthy roommates and past acquantances who had been gobbled up by their roommates: but Bob remained hopeful. He was interested in the mysterious personage with whom he would be spending the next month.<br /><br />A few hours beneath the afternoon's peak sun brought Bob to his dorm; a tall white oak tree in the center of the country campus; easily recognizable from the flier sent home to his nest and well placed among other dormitories. Bob&nbsp;closed in on the white oak and finally broke through the tall grass to view his new home. It was a large grass clearing, separated from view by tall grass blades and ensconced in shade. Bob caught his breath, looked around, and began to realize that there was hardly any room to put down his things. The house twigs which he had collected during his trip did not have any space in the grass clearing, for it was heavily littered with all variety of belongings and foodstuffs. Littered was not the correct word, since the grass beneath the beautiful Oak had in fact been inundated with banana peels, plastic wrappers, mud (or at least what Bob hoped was mud), apple cores, orange peels, and an assortment of strange trash-objects, to which it was impossible to attach a domestic purpose; bizarre pink styrofoam peanuts were strewn across the green lawn, as well as green bubble wrap and moldy soiled bedsheets--most likely stolen from a nearby dumpster; there was a plethora of paper Hamburger wrappers and all shapes and sizes of soda cups. For the life of him Bob could not understand how a single inhabitant had produced such a mess.<br /><br />'Maybe there was a rager here last night.' Bob thought. 'I've heard that there have been a whole lot of raccoons in the area who love to tear away at trash and howl and dance late into the night'.<br /><br />But this document in unkempt housekeeping could not have been created by raccoons, since there were muddy skid marks and deep scrapes in the earth, which could have only been created by animals of a much larger size.<br /><br />'But these troughs in the grass and the paw marks are not from raccoons...'. Thought Bob. 'Must have been someone bigger.'<br /><br />And just then, he looked down at grass and saw an ominous portent of his future summer school home-life; two long bunny-ear shaped impressions, not six inches away from his own tiny claws, showed themselves large and grotesque, reaching deep into the earth : it was the print of a pig.<br /><br />A nervous anxiety then took hold of Bob. His heart thundered and his stomach turned over once. Fits of nausea and vertigo waved through him for a few minutes before he began talking himself through the situation: 'It's okay Bob, everything is going to be fine. We'll just have to wait for the Pig to get home and ask him to clear out a spot for you to live in. Don't worry. Relax. Relax. Relax.'.&nbsp;But the self-talk therapy was no use; Bob now looked upon the grass clearing with amplified repugnance for the inhabitant who created the cesspool. As a reaction to the reality of his domestic situation and the unavoidable roommate interaction he now awaited, Bob was increasingly aware of the sensory insults that approached his person. The thick miasma of decomposing food and moldy bedsheets began to crawl into his nostrils. Bob at first felt only sting of the nostrils upon this awful smell and tried to avoid it by breathing shallowly through his beak, but the stench was insidious; he could almost feel the saturated summer filth-steam seep into his feathers and pores. Bob shivered, became goose-fleshed, and began to hyperventilate; the building concentration of oxygen in his brain only contributing to his vertigo and nausea. The air was quite still and it hung on the wretched, trembling Bob like a wet sheet--soaked in garbage juice. After a few minutes of frantic huffing and puffing beneath the hot summer sun, amid piles of incorrigible nastiness, Bob fainted.<br /><br />Wading slowly through the thrush, a portly and greasy presence drifted towards the white Oak. The green thrush bent and swayed, sticking to oily skin and slicking off body odors of the passerby. Peter the pig, another summer student from down south was just returning from a mid-afternoon romp in the brook. He had waded into the cool waters, defecated, urinated and then rolled around in the brown soil, covering himself with a thick coat of mud. It slowly globbed off his person like beads of thick, crumbly sweat. He relished the feeling of slowly losing mass as his amorphous blob-jacket either dripped from its bottom or caked his back beneath the rising sun. Peter snorted loudly and sampled the air around him, thinking of any treats he may have left at home from last night's scavenging trip. A touch of wind revealed the presence of a visitor at his Oak tree; the visitor was no Pig, he did not have the same salty odor of his fraternity brother Ryan (fellow Pig), nor the furry whiff specific to his classmate Tim (a Dog). This visitor had a very subtle smell, a new one. It was almost sweet in its simplicity. There weren't any of the odiferous foodstuff footnotes he was used to, clinging about his friends like nasal jewelry. This animal had taken great care of his hygiene, he was either a bird or university official.<br /><br />'I hope it's not a public inspection officer' thought Peter. Realizing that once again, that he was staying illegally in this dorm room under the alias of a friend. He had become so comfortable, so deeply entrenched in his lifestyle &nbsp;that it hardly occurred to him that he had been living for almost two months without paying rent or cleaning his room--it was wonderful. Peter had been in rapturous delight of his lifestyle; the complete freedom to spread his things about; to go out late at night in search of sinful snacks and gorging back in the room, falling asleep in bloated delight. He realized all of this could come crashing down if this visitor was a University Public inspection officer, come to kick him off campus. Peter quickened his pace and began to squirm beneath the sun, attempting to shake off some of his mud jacket and prepare for a more formal conversation. He cleared his throat, coughing up an old piece of cheese in the process, burped, and marched forward resolutely to his destiny.
