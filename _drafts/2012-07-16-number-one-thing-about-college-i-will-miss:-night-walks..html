In the interest of shaking the electronic rust off of this blog, and slowly, gracefully parting with the beloved Princeton campus, I would like to briefly describe what it is like to go for a walk in Princeton.<br /><br />Many before me have described the joy of walking and in much better fashion: Thoreau with his somewhat pompous analysis of the word saunter (sans-tierre), F. Scott Fitzgerald describing the walks of Burne Holliday, Ghandi describing his compulsive morning romps; the list of dual walkers-writers goes on and on. Being just a silly college kid alongside such humbling company, I will only attempt to describe why I have enjoyed walking the Princeton campus and try to explain why it has been such a unique joy to this period of my life.<br /><br />The first ingredient to any "magic walk", for a coming of age, somewhat egocentric college student is isolation. In order to accomplish the desired level of cognitive clarity and to disperse adolescent restlessness, one must first put up with a period of uncomfortable silence and physical separation from the society. This separation could manifest itself in a variety of ways; a set of trusty earplugs, mega-huge Bose noise-cancelling headphones, a long trail in the woods, or a peculiar hour in the night/morning. Any of these barriers between the walker and the world will do, but there are different levels of sonic and physical separation. The walker must keep in mind that some screaming babes will not be silenced by expensive Bose headphones or earplugs; one must accumulate barriers them upon eachother in certain instances.<br /><br />The main ingredient to magic of walking in the 08544 orange bubble lies in its safety and isolation. The first ingredient to any successful run, walk, romp, bike ride, canoeing trip, hiking trip, skateboard outing
