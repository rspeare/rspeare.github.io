"Red bulls and Vodka man."<br />"Wow"<br />"He got LIT."<br />"Hammered"<br />"Yeah. Shit was hilarious"<br />"..."<br />"I kid you not. IHOP threw him a going away party like you wouldn't believe: Rented rooms, grey goose, Betties, the works."<br /><br />A casual arm was strewn over the wicker chair, butt slouched forward to the precipice of its cushion; he sat attentively in a Green Bay T-shirt and rimless square spectacles. Both were clad in New Balance sneakers and worn out jeans. They were fit, strong, broad shouldered men; well worked arms filled their sleeves and wide, beer-drinking butts filled their jeans. The more voluble of the two was gesticulating and inflecting like a fraternity brother, approximating his best memories of college and marriage-free debauchery. The waitress approached, and all ribald comments and frattitudinizing were smothered in proportion with her proximity.<br />"Yeah man. Shit was crazy. Have you had the mint tea? I've come here two times, it's good."<br />"And you sir?"<br />"..."<br />"Try it. I'm just relaxing here, try the mint tea. It's pretty good."<br />"..."<br />"We'll get two mint teas over here. No rush. I'm just relaxing here."<br />The waitress clicked away on those steel black heels as both men took in a gratuitous scan. A gilded canvas frame began to oscillate in the convection of agressive air conditioning; its bottom two wall-pinned corners stayed fixed, while the top bobbed in and out, up and down with a patient indifference, increasing and decreasing its angle with respect to the wall like a waving hand.<br />"Yeah man, you shoulda' been there. Bobby had way too much drink. Ha. Yeah. He was GONE."<br />""<br />"You ever been to Vegas? Sweet place. Some of the best 'conferences' I've ever been to, if ya' know what I mean."<br /><br />The more content of the pair stared fixedly at his antagonist, gobbling up stories and taking in the many shots at humor and rodomontade. These poignant bro-mides were standing operating procedure for him. He had seen enough 'man to man'&nbsp;cappuccinos,&nbsp;country club poker tables, tennis locker rooms, and mid summer golf carts; he knew the appropriate frequency of nods and smirks for an all male outing. He knew how to be bawdy and vulgar and loud. He knew how to tease the wife, to deprecate the kids, to denounce the job and fulminate against 'corporate' with the fellow&nbsp;wed-locked.<br /><br />Laden with fiscal responsibility to his two growing children, he had left the country in search of more prosperous emolument; even if it was in the strangest of places: New Zealand, China, Russia, Thailand, Georgia, Iraq, Spain. A few dozen countries and interviews at contracting offices flew through his mind; he been away five years, sending checks home every month to pay for his daughter's education and what seemed and endless onslaught of summer sport camps for his only son. 'That kid better throw 100 mph after all the physical tutelage I've supplied him.' Christ, he had built two houses, just so that little home-wrecker Billy could go to the 'All Star' baseball league summer trip to New York. The duress from his wife was unbearable at times, but he knew that she was intensely proud of him. If only things had turned out different in the States, times couldn't stay so hard.<br /><br />The&nbsp;poignant&nbsp;bro-mides continued.<br /><br />What does it feel like to be an extra-national, a piece of imported labor? He knew better than most at this point, but his experience was a pittance next to the travails of taxi-drivers and Pakistani hard-hats brought in to build those gigantic road systems in the desert. God only knows what their health policy is like. After a brief syncope in Bangkok and a subsequent week of terrified, lonely&nbsp;convalescence&nbsp; he had learned his lesson: never enter a contract without coverage. It was awfully cheap, the type of work some groups will put you through; absolute slave labor; as if, thousands of years later, one was re-constructing the pyramids beneath the Arab sun. But no, no, no. His gig was good at the moment. Another few weeks and he'd be home with his son; able to carry his daughter and make love to his wife; able to drink cold beer in the living room and sink slowly, sedulously into that wonderful black leather couch in front of prime time football. That life was almost too good to be true. How had he become so discontent?<br /><br />Living with 8 other expats in a cramped super-block apartment complex wasn't exactly what he had in mind when he entered the career development center at community college. They told him that he would continue rising up; just keep your head in the game, continually brush up your resume, and 'network'. Reach out all your arms so that you can pull influential people into your purview over time. Perhaps the most influential person he had ever met was this nincompoop, Ron, and he could hardly build a door frame much less pull&nbsp;administrative&nbsp;strings to secure him a higher position.&nbsp;Ron was still going at it volubly, looking for reprieve from his similar responsibilities and unrelenting loneliness though speech. The pining for home and country built itself and swayed them both -- but in vastly different ways.<br /><br />So, Ron did the only thing he knew how to do: he talked.<br /><br />
