Awww yeah.<br /><br />Benny and I arrived in Santiago this morning after an early start from pedrouzo. <br /><br />The pilgrims mass was quite nice and we gotntonhave lunch with Toby before he set off for finisterre. <br /><br />Now sitting in cafe watching Spanish soap operas in a chocolate induced coma, waiting to watch the futbol game between Barcelona and real Madrid with the rest of Spain. Then we'll go back to the hostel and hopefully get a good nights sleep. <br /><br />I expected and actually planned for this last portion of the camino to be quite serious. But with Bennys company, we have been cackling at dirty jokes, drinking beer and developing our potty humor. I take it as God saying "just chill out". Benny has his fantastic gleam in his eye everytime someone speaks to him. As if, even in his mind he is up to no good. I'm going to miss that mischievous twinkle.<br /><br /> Sometimes you can take life too seriously, and the ability to make someone laugh can be just as helpful as a hug. Its been a fantastic finishing the camino with Benny and Toby. Solid bros. <br /> .
