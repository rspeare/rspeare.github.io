Ah, finally. I have arrived in guatemala safely. pictures are coming soon... ;)<br /><br />First of all, lets go over the trip arriving.<br />Leaving the philadelphia airport was the normal drill. Very comfortable atmosphere. I sat in an aisle seat next to... i don´t remember who.<br /><br />however, things got more exciting once in miami. half of the people in the airport were speaking spanish. this is probably because i was in the international section of the airport. i sat down to wait for my flight and started talking with two women who were traveling to guatemala. i thought that they were both friends but they were actually strangers. many of the passengers became much more friendly with each other and were talking endlessly once we were on the plane to guatemala. i am sure that these central americans are much more timid when in the united states and really let loose once they know that they are surrounded by their own people. ah, the advantages of being from a smaller country. i have not noticed the same comradery between americans. during the flight i continued talking with the two women because they happened to have seats right next to me. we talked about lots of things and i tried to be funny to distract them from my heavy american accent. many people told me to be careful in guatemala city so by the time the plane landed i was pretty freaked out.<br /><br />Things got even worse when we exited the airport and there were about 100 people waiting outside of a waist high metal make shift fence with cardboard named tags waving in the air. Thank god, i found my own name and rushed to meet estela, a very nice real estate agent from guatemala city. she whisked me away from the crowd and we got in here nephew´s sports car with techno style inner lighting and tinted windows. what a gangster! i thought, but actually its safer to have dark windows in guatemala city in case of ´ladrones´.<br /><br />So i went to estelas house and had some really sub par chinese food, then left for the alamo bus that would take me to xela in four hours. however, this was four hours of windy mountain roads with mudslides and what not along the highway. the driver was very agressive and confident in his turning and as such, my head and body was thrown from side to side in my aisle seat, chinese food and all. needless to say i had a stomach ache. i told this to my very attractive busmate mely, saying (tengo dolor de estómago). She laughed, agreed and we started talking. That helped the bus trip quite a bit, talking about our favorite music and the international influence of hollywood. finally we reached the bus station at about 7 30. I gave my email adress to mely... hopefully she contacts me :) and then proceeded to wait for someone to pick me up...<br /><br />After about 20 minutes waiting at the station and not knowing what to do, i picked up the courage (coraje) to ask to use the station telephone. I called my homestay and waited for someone to pick up. in between rolling r´s and heavy consonants i understood the words Jovita and Pobrecito. Jovita felt bad for me that i had been waiting at the station. I tried to tell her that i would wait for someone to pick me up, but really had to take my time and repeat the phrase to make sure she understood. After hanging up, i still wasn´t sure if a car was going to come. but i remembered hearing the word verde for <strong>green</strong>, and so after another 15minutes or so, ervin jovita´s son came to pick me up in his sweet range rover. <strong>Finally</strong> i arrived at the house and could settle down safely. unfortunately there was no internet in the house and so i couldn´t contact mom and dad. i would have to wait until tomorrow.
