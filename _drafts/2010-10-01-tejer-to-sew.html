Today, finished up the week and at school. Looking forward to the weekend and a three hour hike to the laguna, which is a sacred lake atop a mountain. This week has been crazy, i am so tired today from all the tea and coffee between classes, incessant socialization with other students, and constant thinking in spanish. i was tired walking home for lunch today i simply could not think in spanish anymore.<br /><br />the viaje or trip today, was a visit to the escuela de tejer, a center for women who want to earn money creating hand woven pieces of clothing in the homes. These women tend to be of mayan descent and either don´t speak spanish well enough to gain a job in town, or only know how to sew. The technique was incredible. i wish i had used my camera, but i may travel back and take a class in order to make my own scarf or bufanda.<br /><br />bought 4 bracelets from there store, each for about 1 us dollar. They thread or ilo is incredible, it is hand dyed and much thicker and stronger than machine made thread. These women had  a lot of pride in their work. Afterwards i walled around with the group, it was just me and three girls and our very feminine possibly gay guide cristian. the trip today was definitely a little feminine, but hey i´m a pretty secure, if not asexual guy. Tonight a lot of people are going dancing, but i am agotado, exhuasted, and so i´m just gonna hit the sack. it´s important to get sufficient sleep when studying and trying to create new nerve pathways!<br /><br />hasta luego,<br />robertooooooooooooooooooooo!
