I've now got something to show for N-body simulations. The attached image is what I'm going to call the 'evil black sphere'. It is over 4 million galaxies. In order to get here, one had to read in the data in C binary, account for errors and hopefully make a program that is well documented so that future undergraduates don't have to suffer my fate, convert the data into vtk format and hope to god you didn't mess up the lines because rendering 4million points takes a lot of time on VisIt's server!<br /><br />Well thank goodness, after way too many mollases cookies and some slobber on my T-shirt, here is the evil black sphere.
