It feels so good to finally have some results! This picture is a smoothed N-body simulation. It is a spherical 'survey' much like we would see from earth out to a redshift of z = .7, or almost 2000 Mpc/h, approximately 8,095,201,294 (8 billion light years). That's a lot of space inside that sphere! Well, its been smoothed with a gaussian smoothing ball of radius 34Mpc/h (147,857,557...147million light years) in order to represent the initial density distribution in the early universe. This structure created by creating a median density contour plot (meaning half the pixels red, half the pixels transparent), creates a SPONGE-LIKE structure. Notice that this crazy looking red sphere is multiply connected and has many holes reaching into its interior! Next step is to quantifiably analyze this surveys' genus statistic (number of holes - number of isolated regions)...</div><div><br /></div><div>Woot woot!</div>
