So, today we hiked up a friggin volcanoe. Pictures coming soon. I have never been so tired. My legs were shaking once we reached the top and it took nearly 2 hours to come back down. Just had lunch with laurel and tomas two other students from my class and weÂ´re just hanging out in the internet cafe. More to come along with pictures later
