Alright, so had a nice 20km day today with Julia. We have stopped in the municipal albergue and these computers are quite nice! Only 1 euro for an hour which is a fantastic deal in comparison to some other places.<br /><br />Just read some articles about inflation in china, I wish Ryan was here to chat about it. Also another article by Paul Krugman called ´lets not be civil´. http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/opinion/18krugman.html?src=ISMR_HP_LO_MST_FB<br /><br />both situations are a little disconcerting. It snice to be off the grid and not know exactly whats going on in the world, but after while I start to feel pretty guilty. Reading el pais is only worth so much, since you only understnad the tone of the enws in your own native language. <br /><br />It is incredible how interconnected our global economy is these days. The fact that one country slows down affects everyone else, and we all must play this constant juggling act to keep afloat. I really hope that the globabl economy frinds some way to rebound soon and that life is easier for those in europe, america, etc. It is just very sad when a country is struggling economically. The unemployment rate here in spain is 22 percent I was told, and you really can tell in certain towns that they are very upset with the way their government has been run. This unhappiness of course carries over quite well with pilgrims because you are at their mercy for food and hospitality. Money might not make you happy on a personal level, but it certainly makes things easier on a macro level. <br /><br />Speaking of economics, my spending on this trip so far has been fantastic! I´ve been staying in donativo albergues when possible, allowing for a lower expense. Also cooking things like pasta and taking advantage of super markets has gone a long way as well. A consistent expense of course is coffee and internet, but those are two things that are difficult to part from (very worth the investment) :)<br /><br />Toby is pushing on closer to Leon to enjoy the city early tomorrow morning, Julia and I have decided to stay here in Mansilla. Its nice to slow down but difficult to do at times on the camino. There is a constant pulling current along the camino that is easy to get caught up in. The legs get restless after so much ingrained walking and you think, hell, I can do another 10k!<br /><br />Oh dear, one of my favorite fellow lady pilgrims just walked in the door. She approached me the other day while I was listening to my headphones and said to me "why do you wear those things". I told her that I liked to listen to music when I feel lonely or need to direct the mood of my thoughts. She said "doesn´t that defeat the purpose of the camino" then continued to talk about how she was looking for a place to stay with nuns... I apologize if I am not a complete sage at the 22 years, but even ghandi was still a bit of a rascal when he was my age, I´ll allow myself some silly pop music. sheesh!<br /><br />Well, lolli, the professional pelegrina, who is 70 and done the camino 12 times is here. This place must be good! Gotta go now, hope your all having a great monday
