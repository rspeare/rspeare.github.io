<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Dear Dr. Blankenship,<br /><br />I would like you to know that my most recent visit to your office was absolutely painless, even pleasant. You have a great gift for soothing patients, getting the job done efficiently, and maintaining the highest level of professionalism. I am extremely fortunate to have you as my Dentist.<br /><br />That being said, I couldn't help but mentally indulge in all the Dentist cliches and stereotypes as you were drilling into my prized enamel this morning. My mind drifts, particularly in uncomfortable circumstances and I would like to take you through a quick tour of what it's like on the other side of your shiny instruments. Perhaps this account will insult you, anger you, or delight you; but I hope that your understanding of this patient will be deepened. I hope that our future eye contact, as I sit beneath your drills and pliers and knives and sterile napkins, will yield a slight chuckle or perhaps a question, as to what I am thinking while you devastate and repair my high-fructose-corn-syrup-corroded teeth.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I follow the blue jumpsuit of a buxom dental&nbsp;hygienist, complete with white surgical mask and furry white slippers, into a cramped corridor of sinks, cabinets, shiny tools and X-ray machines. Each corridor room contains a supine patient with a matted head of hair and two legs sprawled towards a painfully sunny window. It is a glorious day outside and I feel for those souls who must stare directly at the dancing trees amid sounds of suction and the sterile smell of polyurethane: A pacifying tactic, in this case the arrangement of reclining chairs with respect to building windows, can turn into a strident temptation, a pretentious mollification, to the incarcerated patient. I begin to pine after the fresh air and freedom of the world left behind as I follow the blue-suited figure into my predestined dental-cubicle. I'm asked to sit down and I nervously place my hips on the precipice of the not-yet-reclined seat - this is it. Once my bum is firmly placed in this mechanical chair, this charming but ultimately stolid and inaccessible hygienist leans over me to recline the seat and fasten a strange sponge looking knapkin around my neck; She uses an agressive looking silver clamp that reminds me of two alligator mouths, or perhaps car jumper cables to secure it's position on my chest. The hygienist skips out of the room, telling me that the doctor will be a few minutes.<br /><br />I interlace my fingers and gently press their tips into my knuckles. Placing these interlaced hands on my sternum, I take a deep breath.<br /><br />Dum dee dum. Sitting here, now in silence, alone with two fluorescent ceiling lamps buzzing above. Each is covered with an iridescent silver grid that reminds me of a glinting blade. The grids are 38 by 80 squares, about 2,400 little glittering boxes. A more immediate source of light lies not 2 feet from my face, a mouth floodlight. It's snaking handle emanates from the side of the reclining seat like some creepy electronic cyclops. There's a grey plastic pupil in the center of this monstrous tonsil-illuminator and two pointy off white ears (handles).<br /><br />&nbsp;After a few minutes of this childish animation of objects, you (Dr. Blankenship) come in and we're ready to start. A quick brush of some sort of pink glue material, placed at the end of a bent blue Qutip, along the nether regions of my molars. This pink goo tastes strangely good, as if there's been a misplaced artificial sweetener at the Novocain factory. Why is it that I always get this creepy desire to eat the chemicals that are placed inside of my mouth at the dentist? Obviously, dental product manufacturers put flavorings into their bizarre goo to make the experience more 'palatable' for the patient, but what they don't realize is that the tastiness of this possibly deadly substance leads to all sorts of strange self-conscious questions like - Why am I trying to swallow this? Do I have some sort of anesthetic pica? Luckily, life goes on as you pick up a long, mechanical looking syringe and go in for the kill on my root nerves with a fat dose of Novocain. "You're going to feel a slight pinch" you say to me soothingly as the needle descends into my gum-line. A slight twitch in your forearm and rippling of muscles leads me to wonder what's impeding that needles' movement. A steady crescendo of strain in your face and trembling hand communicates the fact that there is some serious pressure being applied to get that needle INSIDE my gums, of which I am now entirely neuro-ignorant. Ah, but there is a slight sensation of swelling in my bottom jaw, where the fluid is being deposited, and, I hope to god, is being dispersed throughout the width of my mouth so that something doesn't just explode down there. Like a deflating water balloon, my cheeks and gums release wonderful numbing chemicals and tingling to the far corners of my mouth and I now realize that I've have been rendered completely defenseless. For the remaining 60 minutes, I have absolutely zilch sensory information as to what is going on down there, and might as well resign to the fact that a large part of my health and well-being is now in your almighty hands.<br /><br />Perhaps this is why Adults with authority and compliance issues have difficulty in your dental chair Dr. Blankenship, because let's be honest, during a typical root canal your prowess over his or her health has risen to practically demigod status. There is a default appreciation of similar power when it comes to NeuroSurgeons, Cardiologists and Oncologists, but in the end teeth are just as important and potentially more painful than a bum knee, aching back, or aging ticker.<br /><br />You casually exchange glinting instruments with your accomplice, the blue-suited hygienist, and my eyes trace the commerce of progressively larger and more malicious-looking tools. Finally, you settle upon a rubber-handled, pen-looking thing, that squirts a tiny stream of water into the air. You say that this is the "hyrdo-drill", the key to getting deep into the molars and confronting my seething cavity. As the chrome, opalescent, beautiful tip of this instrument disappears into my putrid mouth, I begin to feel a high frequency vibration racking through my jawbone and eventually my entire skull and neck: this reminds me of a high-tech jack-hammer pummeling into concrete, which begs the question - where is <i>that</i>&nbsp;thing going? And sure enough, after a few seconds of sustained vibration, my brain gives off a slight wince and I feel my left foot twitch inwards and tap the right ( both are placed tantalizingly close to the window, which could successfully be punctured if one had a running start); this wince, after a few seconds, grows into a roaring, searing flash of hot white light and PAIN, which leads me to believe that <i>this</i>&nbsp;instrument is going SOMEWHERE. I raise a plaintive hand, pleading for your attention to stop the enamel excavation. You say you're sorry. I see eyebrows furrow and realize that you're saying to yourself, 'this sucker's pretty deep, time to bring out the big guns!'. A somewhat larger syringe is now ceremoniously lifted above my crown and I see the intensely luminous turquoise, the fabricated liquid swirl inside the injecting chamber. The needle point descends before my ogling eyes and I watch the blue liquid effervesce and swirl as it is thrust into my gummy flesh; applying all the while, that familiar full and swollen feeling in my jaw and the bitter-cold aftertaste. My neck-hair stands on end and I imagine myself to be a naked boy hit with an elephant tranquilizer, oblivious to all somatic sensation and now properly sedated for exploitation. In an attempt to ease my nerves you say reluctantly, "Ok, now that we've applied this you may have some soreness tomorrow", or as I hear it: 'We didn't want to do this to you but the situation called for it and we're just gonna have to go in for the kill here'. &nbsp;(Reader, don't draw too many sexual connotations from the previous clauses). <br /><br />Now with extensively numbed, perhaps drug-fried gumb-roots, you go to work again, applying the high frequency jack hammer to my molars and digging ever downwards until I'm sure you're closing in on the jawbone. When the critical molar-depth has been reached, you crack and pick away at my deep molars with a diminutive halbert called the "explorer". Then you lather on some new blue goop -- again with the cute blue Qutip -- that has a violent, pervasive aftertaste (I'm definitely not swallowing this stuff). You quick-dry this possibly radioactive blue goop with a mini-tanning-salon gun, which comes complete with UV ray goggles for you and your accomplice: the&nbsp;instrument emits a low hum, emanating from an inner cooling fan, and illuminates the inside of my parched mouth with an alien light that reflects onto both of your orange-Oakley-clad faces.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
