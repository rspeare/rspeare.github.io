After reading the first 150 pages of 'Infinite Jest' by DFW, I have a great appreciation for writers and great communicators of all languages. This book so far has been incredibly dense. There are at least eight words per page that I have never heard of - given that a few are fictitious and made in 'jest' by the author (lolz). It is difficult for me to imagine how one person can fit all of these adjectives, nouns, french phrases and mathematical topics within their brain.  <br /><br />After so many years of focusing on symbols, numbers, and differential letters, it is intoxicating to read fictional prose and enter such eloquent minds. I unfortunately have never had great skill when it comes to words. I certainly read large texts as a kid such as Redwall or Harry Potter, but never reached a high level of reading and writing for a High School Senior, much less a college student. I must admit, this disparity in my training as a student is a small regret that I know can never fully be repaired. The angst and distaste for essays and assigned readings I felt during my freshman year of college (and onwards unfortunately) may have crippled my writing ability for life. It is so refreshing these last few weeks to read voraciously and enter the minds of writer's who I cannot possibly emulate when it comes to conscious thought. My language has become math, logic, symbols, variables, relationships. There are only a certain number of structures you can create with such things and most often the meaning of an equation is quite clear. It is incredible how a reader can derive so many permutations of images, scents, feelings and sounds from a well constructed sentence. <br /><br />I wonder if great authors always observe the world around them with an equal elegance that they display within their works. Is their inner dialogue equally as enchanting and descriptive in real time? Or does the imagination magnify what was initially observed? The latter is actually quite depressing in that a great writer's creation is higher resolution than reality. This could explain why such great writers are often recluses, left alone to delve into their own minds and enjoy the environment that only they can create, destroy, control and manipulate. <br /><br />Of course after reading for an extended period of time tonight I found myself imitating the narrative of 'Infinite Jest', conjuring all my vocab muscle to describe the dormitory bathroom. The results were not very impressive. How on earth does one's mind 'race' and create expressions, sentences, thoughts and ideas in rapid succession? How does one foster a more articulate inner dialogue that can describe the world in terms that enhance and improve it? There are a few people within my college who display a great ability when it comes to prose, communication, inner dialogue etc. For example, one student who often gives presentations and participates in precept speaks so fast that I simply cannot decode all the information being transmitted into the air. It is a coincidence that we have been discussing special education students within my Teacher Preparation class and such student's classroom experience. Supposedly, many special education students perceive a huge increase in the rate of speech by the teacher and fellow students, which causes them great stress and anxiety during class discussion and questioning. I have to admit, during many of my conversations with this atypically high-speed communicator, I feel like an anxious special education student. In fact, I feel very much the same way during all of my Thesis advisee meetings, where the rate of speech is slow but riddled with terminology and dense logic that I simply cannot follow in real time. <br /><br />Those who have the ability to digest huge amounts of information via language - I am envious. Those who can listen to a song on the radio, recognize speech patterns despite distracting bass drops and rock guitar, emerge with a perfect memory of the lyrics - I am also envious. Those who can sustain a library of words to describe the world around them and decode any literary piece placed in front of them - ditto.
