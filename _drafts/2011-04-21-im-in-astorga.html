Fantastic walk today. Got a lot to tell, so I¨m going to post this up first and then tell the whole story.<br /><br />First of all, started the day in absolute beast mode today. Was very pissed quite frankly that yesterday was cold and unrelenting rain for 6 hours. I went to bed cold and very unfortable, hoping that in the morning enough clothes would be dry for the walk. A woman also said last night that the shops will be closed for the next 3 days, oh... and that its going to continue raining until next monday. Sheesh. WEnt to sleep on a big downer.<br /><br />So when I awoke this morning and saw some clear sky, I bolted out the door. I was so determined to get some kilometers in during the good weather, and I could sense my mental and physical commitment to really crushing the stage, it gave me goosebumps. So, I walked 25k non stop. HOly shynkees! I love those moments in life when you let your intensity run away with you but its OK.<br /><br />Took a break at a nice bar outside of astorga and got a sandwich, talked with a cute little girl who just hangs out at the bar with her dad, then set off for the final 6k to astorga. <br /><br />But strangely enough, I came upon a place called la casa de los dioses, a little shack basically in the middle of a field where a small tienda was set up with cookies, tea and random snack. The man attending the store was sitting on a couch in flip flops, loose fitting yoga pants, and mountain hard ware jacket. He told me that everything was a gift to pilgrims and that you can donate if you like. <br /><br />AFter I had helped myself to some cookies and nutella, it started to rain so I helped him pull a tarp over his shop and over the couch. I asked him where he lived and he said here. I thought he meant inside the building, but what he really meant is on the ratty couch that was sitting outside. This shocked and scared me, because I realized I was essentially alone in the rain with a homeless man who had just given me some food. <br /><br />But curiousity took over so I didn´t flee, and asked him some questions about why he was he living here alone and where he grew up. He told me in his broken english about how the camino had really changed his life, and he wanted to continue being a part of it through this donativo stand. He has a facebook group and a donation foundation apparently that is restoring the building to help pilgrims. When asked him about his childhood he misunderstood, and started talking about his inner child little david. He let it slip that he had led a very bad life earlier, involved in smoke, drugs, alcohol etc. He said that by living the simple life, he feels more simple inside. By cleaning and caring for others he feels cleaner inside.<br /><br />Whoa. I felt like I was in the middle of the movie "into the wild". Once the rain stopped, I went on my way and asked if I could take his picture. <br /><br />Probably not the best idea to have stopped and had some of those cookies as I joke with toby now at the computers. They could have been drugged or something and I would essentially be isolated with a homeless man. But, the coincident meeting I´ll take as a gift from God. The sudden pouring rain almost seemed to be a message to sit down and hear what he has to say. <br /><br />Of the things we talked about, what I took away ultimately was the practice of meditation. David said that a happy life involves living simply and meditation. Which, can be done at any time. It is simply focusing on your respiration and your sensation. A lot of people on the camino talk about walking meditation, so I tried to focus on that a little bit the last couple miles and it was very nice. Focusing on your breath is always a great thing to do I think because it calms you and reminds you of a constant rythym that everyone must follow. Gotta breathe til your dying breath right? A lot of the songs on my iPod talk about that coincidentally. <br /><br />But focusing today on the rain, the cold wind, the sporatic sun, and an aching shin was a very cool experience. Its like getting splashed in the face with cold water. When your outside, moving, paying attention to your body, its very awakening. Better than caffeine. WAy better.<br /><br />Now chillin with toby in the albergue, legs are feeling good. Looking forward to taking a stroll around the city and looking for a marmot store. I gotta get a better poncho, because this 7 dollar one sucks!<br /><br />Luv,<br />rob
