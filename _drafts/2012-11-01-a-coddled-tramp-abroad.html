<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />The city was concealed in darkness.&nbsp;To the sounds of a post-vietnam radio, our diminutive taxi rocked and rolled over -------'s dusty potholes and crevices in search of a budget traveller's hotel. Sparse lamplight shed obfuscation-salvation onto a few granular rock piles and&nbsp;somnambulating&nbsp;cows, who looked askance at us with sallow and jaded eyes. Who knows what those cows were seeking, what smells they were pursuing, I could not discern the slightest thing due to the detritus lodged in my nostrils. Gangs of men -- and boys -- emerged from the darkness in ominous lines of nine and ten; dogs trailing them in mimetic, delinquent packs.<br /><br />This unsettling scene was the beginning of my vacation: Piles of stone and trash lined the road; incondite wooden houses threw bleak incandescent light into the streets; decrepit and wrinkly walkers sauntered in the gloom; sparse jalopies tumbled along broken cement. A bomb had dropped on this place, but where was the mushroom cloud?...</div>
