Okay, so after a bad taco... i've got a date with el trono or = the bathroom; however, great opportunity to watch online lectures from berkely on computer science, physics, french, and buddhist psychology. Here are some factoids!<div><br /></div><div>in current central processing units or (cpu's) there is less than 45nm between every transistor/every wire. This is 45 times 10 to the -9! A human hair is 100 1000 times thicker than this! This means that current cpus are incredibly incredibly highly concentrated.</div><div><br /></div><div>A typical clockrate, or average time between arithmetic or logic operations in current cpus is about 3.5 GHz, or 3.5 billion operations a second. Back in 1960, you were lucky to get 45 arithmetic operations. Why has this sped up so much? Well back in the day they used some pretty slow materials to change bits, such as vacuum delay lines where you would shoot electricity through a crystal or some sort of channel and literally wait for it to come out the other side. Nowadays, electric signals simply don't have to travel so far and don't encounter as much resistance (therefore propogate faster) in "integrated circuits" which use silicon and other new synthetetic materials.</div><div><br /></div><div>But, power dissipation is ~1/2CVVf (one half Capacitance times Voltage Squared times frequency). What does this mean? This means that since the operating frequency of a cpu is sooooooooooo high, it gets hotter than a domestic stovetop when operating. Mind you a cpu is about the size of one graham cracker (and no, i don't mean the sheet, i mean one little graham cracker). Think about this, you could put a frying pan on top of the cpu unit in your computer and boil water or cook an egg. Holy shit. So, all cpu units these days are surrounded by heat dissipating wafers/cases, not to mention lots of fans and stuff. So when that computer is burning your lap, just remember that there are of 3 billion instructions being fed through that cpu unit every second, it would make your brain melt too right?</div><div><br /></div><div>But because of this incredible heat, the technology community has hit a huge obstacle. If we continued to push the limits of clock rate and the number of instruction we could theoretically put through a cpu, we could make it as hot as a nuclear reactor, or even the surface of the sun! So what do we do? We slow down the clock rate and split up the work between multiple brains or cpu's.</div><div><br /></div><div>Ever heard of a core intel duo processor? That's two cpu's working together! They require the same power to operate, but increase performance by about 80 percent. Why not 100 percent? Double the cpu double the computing power right? wrong. </div><div><br /></div><div>Most problems in our world are sequential, they require steps to be done in a specific order. For example; *(20-12)x42)x12. You have to work from the inside out correct? First do the operation 20 - 12, then multiply by 42, then multiply by 12. Well what if cpu 1 isn't done 20-12 yet? Then cpu 2 has to wait for cpu 1. Problems like this are called unparrarellizable, meaning that they can't be split up very well into unsequential parts. </div><div><br /></div><div>In fact, the playstation 3 has over 8 cpus inside of it! It is one of the most beautiful machine architectures ever made. More advanced than many of the laptops and desktops out on the market right now; however, it has really crappy games so no one gets to enjoy its computing power... :(</div><div><br /></div><div>So the future of computer programming is what's called parallelization, splitting problems into chunks that many different cpus can digest. And since building computer RAM space, cpus, and memory is getting cheaper and cheaper, many companies now use what's called distributive computing to tackle huge computation requests. </div><div><br /></div><div>for example, Google. Uses TONS of really small compact computers, thousands in fact. These computers are kept in a facility, either in computer racks placed in the back of 18 wheel trailers, or held up by velcro to the walls of the facility. The number of computers running/searching is determined by how many requests are within the server or "data center". When a computer unit/cpu is not needed it is disconnected and left idle to wait for the next one of us looking for "recipes for cordon bleu" or "species of zebra" through the google search engine on google.com. </div><div><br /></div><div>And you wanna talk about hot! These computer units are on allll the time, so we're talking about some serious heat. Sun microsystems sells giant trailers equipped with their own cooling systems, and google uses giant rooms equipped with fans, microcoolers, etc. 5% of our petroleum consumption is put towards server 'cooling'. Pretty crazy right? There were even myths about google creating an oil rig type apparatus on the ocean to naturally cool large distributive computing units using the ocean waves. This actually might be happening...</div><div><br /></div><div>Ok, so what's even crazier is there's this idea called 'cloud' where you can rent out huge amounts of computing power from this giant server centers. For example, what does amazon.com do with all of its free computing power outside of the christmas season? Rent it out. For about 80cents an hour, you can rent the computing power of up to 100 laptops! Wanna do some serious research or run a crazy complex program? Rent computing power through clouds?</div><div><br /></div><div>Mom, this factoid is for  you. Genetic researchers are outputting about 10TB a day of new data. Now all the supercomputers today have very long queue's of scientists waiting to access their sweet cpu power. however, with cloud computing, specifically amazon.com's EC2 program, you can access 10,000's of computers with your credit card! If your a scientist willing to pay, you've got your own supercomputer, no waiting involved!</div><div><br /></div><div>What else... the charger on this comp is awful. electronic repairs are quite ftustrating here.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
