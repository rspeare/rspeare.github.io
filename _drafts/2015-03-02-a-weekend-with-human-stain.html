<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">--- Spoiler alert --- So I’ve been reading “The Human Stain” by Phillip Roth, and it is amazing. Like “Operation Shylock”, completely unhinged. Roth is hilarious and deep-thinking about the many factors that make a person feel injustice in life, about the many historical, racial and sexual factors that make American morality, American piety, and “convention”. He’s a bit tedious in distenangling the various thought processes of his characters: a feminist French professor who secretly harbors more conventional feelings towards males than she lets on — “a chauvinist in drag” as she is called by more feminist-faithful faculty — who parrots the language of literary theory in order to advance her career, even if that language and its snooty, strident phrases don’t match her feelings; a Vietnam vet who feels cursed by his country and his wife for having treated him as strange and dangerous, as someone who had the capacity to kill and came back from the jungle deeply bigoted; a Jewish classics professor who is spuriously accused of using racist speech in class when referring to two regularly absent students as ‘spooks’ — who, turned out to be black, and grasped the opportunity for indignation — which, ironically is a word he should use quite freely since HE is secretly Black himself, but lied and said he was a white Jewish man in order to advance HIS career on equal grounds with everybody else; of a woman who is beaten down by the death of her children, by her husband (literally), and a father who sexually abused her beneath the blind, purposefully un-perceiving eye of a status-dependent wife. [It turns out, this woman may have even lied about her&nbsp;childhood to the story-teller, Nathan Zuckerman, in order to cover up a dark history of drugs and extortion. It's very confusing.]&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br /></span><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Who, for the most part, all hate each other. For various reasons. It seems as though if you pick an ethic or a personality, you can’t help but rage — and feel pleasure in that rage — against many, many people. Roth begins the book by talking about 1998 and America’s “piety binge” against Bill Clinton for having had `sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. He refers to it as a year long indulgence of sanctimony: “the ecstasy of sanctimony”. He&nbsp;says — or really, Zuckerman says — that he would like to see a giant banner put in front of the white house during this “piety binge” that reads “A HUMAN BEING LIVES HERE”, which, shows you where Roth — or Zuckerman — stands on the subject. This interest in moralizing, in taking offense — even the slightest offense — and amplifying it with convenient thought is wholly strung out in &nbsp;“The Human Stain”.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br /></span><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">With all those complex stories in hand, Roth goes to amazing lengths to theorize the exasperation of each and every character. It is overwhelming. Just like “Operation Shylock”, it's clear that Roth — or Zuckerman, (to hedge) — has gone off his rocker and let himself, in full fulsome form, elucidate the mental gymnastics required to engineer your own crucifixion — be it philosophical or social or at its worst, semiotic — to write your own trembling, self-justifying catechism. The hilarious stuffiness of the academy. The hilarious bro-bonding and platitude-ridden culture of Veteran’s recovery groups and Alcoholics Anonymous. The hilarious gossip-mill that is a provincial Northeastern town. The hilarious recklessness Viagra lends to an aging man and a woman who only wants what is predictable. It all boils down to a big joke, of Dostoevksy’s postulating their own offense, their own license to crawl into the underground and nurse old, cherished wounds. And what’s weird is, there’s nothing to learn from it. The final lesson is that there is no lesson, there is no “answer”, and there is no “right”. Nothing can be understood or taken away: only the barest impression of the confounding “superabundance” of life, the billions of details we can’t possibly hold. So there is no take away, there is no joke even, it’s just something that we feel and hear and read, are affected by, and that’s it.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br /></span><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Kind of downer. And yet, there is a funny connection to be made with all of this philosophical writhing and posturing so as to receive the most gratifying slight, to scratch that well-worn Russian itch of revanchist insolence for insolence, intimated insignificance for intimated insignificance, quid pro quo, and it’s that maybe DFW was right when he said there’s something basic and infantile in all of us, that in fact, to be human is to harbor an — oft disgruntled — inner child. Except he didn’t get it right in the cuddly, helpless way some may read in such a statement, it might not have to do with puerile dependence on others, but puerile attachment to being wronged, to telling ourselves that we’ve been wronged, over and over and over again until we can’t stop because it feels too good, or because we’ve vocalized ourselves too far into a structured, restricting, ethic. Maybe all these raving Russian madmen of Dostoevsky were doing was just crying home to mama, or crying home about how disappointing mama -- or obviously papa -- was: after all, a baby is many things if not a little resentful and a little conceited [Camus' line, not mine]. Many times I have seen a mother and a child, a father and a child, struggle for authority in the subway or in some restaurant, simultaneously pleading — between bouts of moaning &amp;&nbsp;yelling &amp; wrestling &amp; fussing — to bystanders for pathos, as if with their eyes they were&nbsp;groaning “Look how AWFUL this person being to me!”. Yes, maybe that might be the onanistic &amp; Freudian seeds&nbsp;of what Roth calls the subversive pleasure of sanctimony, of self-righteousness. This, and the circus it causes, is what “The Human Stain” is about.</span></div>
