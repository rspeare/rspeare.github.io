So I have gotten pretty close with the caretakers here in the hostel. It is almost a family run business. The woman Sylvia who works from 6:30 to 6:30 every weekday is very talkative and fun. Her brother Edin works the other shift 6:30pm to 6:30am letting people into the hostel and taking care of things. (he also works another job). The bartender Giovanni is a good person with a very interesting history. I am teaching Gio English and we are taking lots of walks around the city together, he is almost like a politician around here with how many people he knows. <div><br /></div><div>Unfortunately, today Edin's wife died due to pregnancy complications at 5 months. The twins supposedly had already passed, but there was an infection and therefore surgery became complicated. Edin has 2 daughters, however I think that they are separated and therefore the children may have nowhere to go. Sylvia and her aunt were crying this afternoon, but life goes on. Sylvia is directing new workers around the hostel and inviting new caretakers because of a recent renunciation. </div><div><br /></div><div> I have posted this story because it serves as an emotional focus. The tigers won heps today, and I had felt very sad earlier for having missed out on the experience as well being so far away from my former life. The team will probably celebrate tonight, some will get very inebriated and do stupid things to blaring rap music and finally return to their dorms along the safe, developed, and beautiful streets of Princeton. This doesn't make my teammates bad people, or Sylvia's family saints for having suffered so much today, it is only that the contrast is quite astounding. Two events so immediate in my life experience are so incredibly different. And one underlying message of it all seems to be that "you are not the center of the universe". </div><div><br /></div><div>As I talk about this with Gio in spanish, he tells me that "life is a game, the pieces continue moving". This is coming from a guy who's father was murdered, his family's store was destroyed by gangsters, was so deep in drug addiction that he couldn't feed himself or walk.</div><div><br /></div><div>Direct translation: happiness is like pastillas, pills/medicine for the soul. We are all happy for a little bit of time, but it's not incredibly long. You don't have to be sure about any moment, because death can come at any time. Live in the moment, each minute until the last minute of your life.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Culture shock is a push towards the center of human experience"</div>
