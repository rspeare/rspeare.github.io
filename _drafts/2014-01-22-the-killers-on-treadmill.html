<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">“All of these things that I’ve done” came on the gym speakers today. It was during my vespertinal grime fest, an hour of sweating, no, excreting the oils of life here (both in food and thought). I was ripped back in time, eight years ago, to a mountain in Sunday River, Maine.<br /><br />It was August 6th, 2006. I was just putting the cap on an 84 mile week, full of hot dogs and striders and sit ups and grueling runs on the Amish hills of Millersville, PA. I had received some sort of “toughness” award from the “Marauder” Cross Country camp that I had attended. Confidence was flying high.<br /><br />Each morning, at camp, we 300ish boys and girls — there seemed to be a larger number of girls than boys, but perhaps my memory is bent by prurient prominence — were split into three groups. Group I was the fastest group, a selection of relatively few campers who wanted to run 6:30 miles (or below, depending upon the testosterone level of the day) for about ten miles. Group II ran about 7:00 miles, and constituted, for both sexes, the overwhelming majority of the camp. Group III ran 7:30′s or above, for males. (Groups were also split into male and female, for good reason, as you can tell by my slightly energetic sidenote on population numbers above.) I had raced those early morning distance runs, pounded the asphalt with such reckless abandon, that by the end of the week, I had trouble getting out of bed and into short shorts without the help of a very hot shower; and, by the end of the week, during those morning parceling sessions, I saw the Group I numbers dwindle, as other boys meekly covered their crotches and backed away: I stood triumphant, chin held high, legs in lactic agony.<br /><br />And so this week of torturing myself and others led to a trip with family to Maine, where I restlessly sought the same holy conviction and challenge, felt by so many preparing distance runners, logging miles for the season ahead. Base, as they call it: every mile is money in the bank.<br /><br />I attempted to run up a 3-mile “green” skiing trail called Lollapalooza, a winding — not so “green”, or “flat”, or “easy” — course, which took one home from the top of the Jordan mountain to the Jordan Grand Hotel — thus, the euphemistic “green” labeling of what should obviously have been a “blue”; imagine telling your five year-old child, “Okay, we’re going to go down a ‘blue’ now!” at the end of a hard day. How many tears and unnecessary questionings of skier-self were caused by this mislabeling, I know not: but there were plenty of rigid backs going down those icy slopes at the end of a cold day; Lollapalooza had a talent for making snow-neophytes anal-retentive in skiing-form through fear.<br /><br />So I tried to run up this sucker, but found that the only traversable path was littered with enormous rocks the size of coffee cups — everything else was weeds &amp; boulders, impassable. So I trudged and wobbled on this winding rocky way, ankles afire, like Frodo scurrying up to Mordor, and what was I listening to but The Killers, “All the things that I’ve done”. On repeat. yes, running often makes monotony an ideology, and I massaged my ‘soul’ by listening to that song, arms electric with frisson, pumping frantically to the top.<br /><br />Wide-eyed and emotional, I reached the summit at 6:30, just when sunset eclipsed far off mountains. A fierce wind blew in my face as I made the final steps, tripping and driving and stumbling over those damn rocks, quads in excruciating pain. (Swollen in fact, by their continued anaerobia.) The physical elation I experienced, scaling that mountain, listening to the words “I’ve got soul but I’m not a soldier. I’ve got soul but I’m not a soldier” again and again, accelerating, expanding each time they hit my hears, causing me to sprint in histrionic glee — it all came back on the treadmill this evening. The goosebumps, the hairs on end. The cold wind and dying sun. Fucking rocks. I could die with all that detail (as Roth might say), buried beneath 6 feet of memory.<br /><br />Music has this gift, where if you lend yourself to it, dip your hand in the stream of nostalgia, an enormous rush washes over you.<br /><br />Such, such were the miles.</div>
