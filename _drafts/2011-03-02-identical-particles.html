So what if our wavefunction Psi describes, not one, but two particles? For instance, well known closed solutions (however complicated) are known for the hydrogen atom and fairly simple potentials in three dimensions. But say we are interested in tracking the behavior two particles in a system. Now since each wave function represents a statistical distribution, we can simply multiply each particles wave function Psi to get the correct/total probability. this is similar to rolling two die and keeping track of the outcome of both dice rolls, you simply multiply their probability functions. Example<div><br /></div><div>Probability P= P1 * P2</div><div>Die Probablity P = P1 * P2 = 1/6 * 1/6 </div><div>(probability of snake eyes or rolling 12)</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, there is a problem here unfortunately. Because there is no way for us to make a measurement on ANY quantum mechanical particle without collapsing its wavefunction onto some eigenvector, we can't actually tell which particle is which. We can't simply call 2 electrons, A and B, because we have no way to measure them. So, one must create a total wavefunction that is non-commital as to which particle is which. For instance:</div><div><br /></div><div>Psi = Psi_1 (electron a) * Psi_2 (electron b)+/- Psi_2 (electron a)*Psi_1(electron b)</div><div>this stands for one wavefunction, plus or minus the other. Where the input to each is either the position of electron 'a' or electron 'b'. Now we have constructed a state in which we don't actually have to know which electron is which, we have accounted for both possibilities using the superposition. </div>
