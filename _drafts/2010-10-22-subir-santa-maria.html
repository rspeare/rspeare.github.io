This plan fell through, and although the salsa dancing, movie going, and nice restaurant was great. I felt like (tenia ganas de) climb that darn volcano. So thursday morning I told my friend christian who lives in the city of xela that i was going to climb santa maria and spend the night on the summit. He was very excited and wanted to come with, so i said sure lets do it. Then of course my friend thomas from utah heard about the trip and he is a hiking expert, so there's three. Finally, one the spunkier teachers in casa xelaju claudia wanted to come as well. <div><br /></div><div>So, we met at 6 outside my hostel to go hike up santa maria under a full moon, hopefully spend the night, and return friday. Waiting for a bus to llanas to pinal (town of pine trees), we left from the cemetary around 7 to arrive to the beginning of the trail around 8. the bus ride was a little hairy given the number of people, had to keeps the hands in the pockets... </div><div><br /></div><div>Taking all of my possessions out of the hostel and placing them into my camping 65 liter north face back pack, i looked ridiculous next to thomas who had only packed a bag the size of one pillow, filled with a sleeping pad, blanket, and two emergency layers; however, i wanted to make this trek hard and have lots of comfortable materials on top such as clean/dry socks and underwear...</div><div><br /></div><div>After 2 hours of hiking under the full moon we reached the meseta, or half way point. I thought that we were almost finished since a fellow student from england had told me he had summitted in 3 hours. However, it was far from over. After the meseta the path became very difficult and the inclination was so strong we had to use all four appendices to climb up rocks, roots, and slippery switchbacks. Thank god the moon was out, it made things so much easier and i was able to save lots of battery on my headlamp (don't worry meg it's not yours, no soy ladron como tu ;) </div><div><br /></div><div>To be continued... need to walk to work</div><div><br /></div><div><p class="MsoNormal">Ok, so after starting the second half of the hike, things were pretty tough, but the air was fresh and cool and the effort was balanced and slow. Every time we stopped we took a look up the mountain thinking, oh god how much more. Finally after 3 more hours of hiking, just before midnight the ground began to level out and I broke into a run to reach the top first. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal">The sight was unbelievable, almost a mile below us in altitude lay xela with all her lights and people, and surrounding santa maria’s peak were fellow volcanoes and mountain ranges. The moon definitely seemed bigger ;) . However, it was windy and cold as heck on the top, so we couldn’t spend too much time just watching the scenery. My jeans, socks and shirt were soaked with sweat. So I set up the tent and changed. A little more time to explore and admire the stars, and then we all hurried off to bed. Thomas found a rock pocket with wind cover and set up is efficient camp. Cristian and Claudia cuddled up together outside on my rain tarp, and I tried to position the tent so that the full moon was directly above my head. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Ew boy, those little piggies were a freezing! My feet were unfortunately the one thing I had forgotten to really take good care of. I only had one other dry pair of socks, and I definitely needed two to keep those piggies warm. So, most of the night was spent rubbing my feet together trying to create some heat. Cristian and Claudia would not stop giggling outside, they were so funny. Unfortunately though, they were freezing! In the morning their blanket and sleeping bags were frozen solid.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">This morning was the first time that my tent zipper has frozen shut, I had to rub it little bit just to get out. At 5:30 this morning I sat down outside, freezing my buns off to watch one of the most beautiful sunrises of my life. It was actually quite a nice social scene, since Cristain Claudia and a high school group from casa xelaju were there to watch. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal">To describe the scene, I would have to say that I have never seen so many clouds. I hope the following pictures give justice to any attempted further description.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">One comical note is that there is a girl named Rebecca in the interim group carpe diem from the US who lives in Swarthmore, we took a picture together on the summit this morning so her mom could put it in the swarthmorean.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">And now picture time… (I might have to wait for some of me taken by other people since my camera battery died.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="ES" style="mso-ansi-language:ES">Estoy bien, estoy vivo.
