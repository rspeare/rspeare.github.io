The finder application isn't doing the job because the file is in some obscure place on the hard-drive. The spotlight application is great and fast, but you're not getting the right file because you can't feed the program correct criteria for a search. Or, you're looking for a certain file that you accessed, changed, or created at a certain date. You should use the find command in terminal!</p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2">Open up terminal from the utilities directory, or type command-space, then type terminal and click enter. You'll see the following:</p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2">yourusernamehere $ </p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2">Now, the first argument (thing you put after the command call) is the directory to be searched. You can either type a specific address for find to start at, then move recursively down the directory structure such as</p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2">rob$ find /Users/rob/Documents</p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2">You can also use "." to start your search from the current directory (because that is what  "." represents). Or you can use ".." to start the search from the directory immediately above.</p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2">However, this input alone will not work. You need to define some search parameters. In all UNIX commands there are things called 'flags' which are options that allow you to configure the execution of a command, they always start with a " - ". For example, the -l flag for the ls command allows you to see the file type and ownership when displaying directory contents. </p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2">Now back to find, there are some very important and useful flags called 'primaries' which you can use to define your search. </p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2">-name (searches for all filenames containing the given string/pattern)</p> <p class="p2">rob$ find /Users/Documents -name "project1" (This will search through all my documents and return any file names containing "project1".)</p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2"> Now let's make it a little fancier, how about we search for all project numbers using what's called a wildcard.</p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2">rob$ pwd</p> <p class="p2">/Users/rob</p> <p class="p2">rob$ cd Documents</p> <p class="p2">rob$ find . -name "project*"</p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2">This will return project1 project2 project3 etc. You can make the search case insensitive by using -iname instead of name.</p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2">Now how about we're just looking for something that we were working on last week, but we forgot the document name. Using the primaries -amin and -atime we can search for files accessed x number of hours minutes, days, seconds ago (amin only uses minutes )For example:</p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2">rob$ find . -amin -60</p> <p class="p2">Lists all files under the current directory that were accessed in the last hour. </p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2">rob$ find . -atime -1w2d1h1m1s</p> <p class="p2">Lists all files that have been accessed in the last 1 week, 2 days, 1 hour, 1 minute and 1 second (that's a little too exact). </p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2">These are the two most powerful primaries (in my opinion) on find, and you can combine them both to further specify your search</p> <p class="p1"><br /></p> <p class="p2">rob$ find . -atime -1w -iname "forgotten file"</p>
