<br />Rippling and tawny forearms decorated with tattoos, black leathery skin stretching over enormous biceps, deltoids, into a thick sessile neck. A black T-shirt hangs from his shoulders like a circus tent. He is wearing white and Turquoise board shorts and flip flops, along with a raised pair of aviators -- the paragon of masculinity. Triangular calves collapsing into thin, hard and exposed achilles. Those legs are used to jumping. A mandible that juts down so steeply, with such a wide jaw base -- ending in an enormous butt chin -- as to arouse suspicions of Down Syndrome, Steroids, or a Tumor in the tongue bed.<br /><br />'I want a cappuccino.'<br />'Okay sir.'<br /><br />Two children clamour and drag their sweaty hands across the glass barrier between their bulging eyes and an display shelf of pastries. They are each enveloped in an enormous forearm. It's amazing that the silver rolex -- adorning one of the Popeye appendages -- has not popped off, given the undulating thews beneath. Our strongman looks over the menu once more and then turns and taps into his Blackberry -- extremely carefully given the size of his knuckle-centric paws -- heading towards the cafe window while milk is steamed.<br /><br />A tall dark woman stands idly by a table in the corner. She has enormous legs, tinged with cellulite, that disappear into black running shorts and a protruding bum -- more like a fleshy shelf; those running shorts are billowing about her hamstrings in the air conditioning. She has needle thin eyebrows, and a tight, indigenous ponytail, angled up and out from her cranium at a forty-five degree angle. Neck like a giraffe. She wears very large and very dark aviators, with a white wife beater. Mascara and diamond earrings. She simultaneously looks the part of motorcycle amazon and vegas debutante. She's quite the corporeal match for our strongman, given the wide-set shoulders and girthy arms.<br /><br />Her countenance carries a static snarl, as if dung was bitterly smeared under her nostrils. She puts up her palm towards the Barista's back -- who is at this moment making her husband's cappuccino -- and shouts,<br /><br />'HEY.'<br /><br />No response. The hissing of steamed milk and espresso douses her call.<br /><br />'HEY!'<br /><br />Still, the barista doesn't hear. She turns toward her husband with an open mouth -- who is talking by the door in a Latino accent, offering to Tommy to 'jump in the sea or sumthin' ' -- and throws up her hands in disgust. The kids continue to drool over tarts.<br /><br />The kids sit down with their father and begin to speak in Portugeuse. The woman remains by the cafe counter and eventually loses her patience. 'Hey.' Finally, eye contact from the barista -- jeeze -- "for Me, two cappuccino. One for him, one for me. Ok? I want a cappuccino.' She talks slowly with widened vowels and widened eyes, jutting her chin back and forward in gesticulation, as if she wouldn't be understood otherwise.<br /><br />[An observer -- '...' -- might tell himself that such categorical cappuccino ordering has to do with the language barrier; But that observer would be wrong.]<br /><br />The children sit patiently beside their father, calves oscillating like anxious pendulums from round nascent knees. Mother returns to the table and contemplates the floorboards behind aviators. The angle of her immaculate eyebrows is so steep, so like a V, that she *must* be squinting. Her husband gets up to check on the drinks and waits at the counter, phone in hand, tapping away.<br /><br />'Do you want it with skim milk sir?'<br /><br />'Whole? Whole milk.'<br /><br />'Yes, do you want it with skim?'<br /><br />'No. Skim. Skim milk.'<br /><br />'Yes sir. What do you want?'<br /><br />'Skim. Skim Milk.'<br /><br />'Ok sir I'll make it for you now.'<br /><br />'No it's Ok...'<br /><br />The barista waves him off with her hand. She bustles back into the kitchen and gets a new ground of espresso. He watches her disappear into the kitchen and apologetically walks back to his family. They wait in silence.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />The two adults have such dark skin, but unnaturally so, as if those stretched, tanned hides were formed by weightlifting in the sun. Two adherents to muscle beach. After an hour the kids receive their treat, a whopping slice of chocolate cake that practically gives each a tragic, rapture-induced aneurysm. Their soft eyes and noses crinkle in delight after each mouthful. The adults are still finishing their cappuccinos as a heaping plate of meat, potatoes and broccoli is placed in front of our Strongman.<br /><br />He holds fork and knife like toothpicks between his fingers, thumbs up, forearms raised in the military anxiety of one who often eats in caloric desperation. He picks apart the baked potato meticulously. The dexterity of his enormous hands -- which are constantly in position to slam down onto the table -- is a product of edacious affection. He chews slowly, as if the muscles that riddle his face, like the rest of his body, make it difficult to move his jaw. Although, it is a large jaw. His wife watches him eat longingly, her chin in palm, arm elbow-propped on the table. She has a backwards slanting forehead. A glowing and dark, Indian complexion. The children continue to squeal in delight.<br /><br />Sunlight from outside brings an intense, fluorescent pink glare to the glasses on the table.<br /><br />The father gets up to go to the bathroom, giving a frail comment in transit to his wife. She looks into the ground like a beaten woman.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
