The one and only starbucks in the charles de gull airport is located in terminal 1. Itnhappens to be right across from the continental airlines kiosk. Coincidence? I think not.<br /><br />Gosh, French people can be quite rude when asked to speak English. Pui je parlez anglais avec tu? Bam, they hate you.<br /><br />But oh boy are some these french women beautiful... Whoa!
