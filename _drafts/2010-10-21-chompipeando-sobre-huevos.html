<div>I'm chillin in the hostel salida, listening to sweet electronic music and having some eggs after a very memorable. Life doesn't get much better than this :)</div><div><br /></div><div>Last night the crew went to go see a guatemalan flick called aqui me quedo, which means here I stay. it was a movie very proud of the xela and the general environment of quetzaltenango. Very difficult to understand, but luckily I had my teacher next to me explaining every now and then. Afterwards, we went to a very nice atmosphered bar, which I will have to take a picture of later. Imagine a giant cathedral style hallway three stories tall, with candle-lit tables lining the sides. Had a great ensalada cesara and played lots of spanish jokes on the other students with my teacher and friend christian. Then, we went to a salsa club called la parranda, where I got to salsa for real for the first time after many lessons. It was fun but very difficult. Salsa requires the male to very assertive and unfortunately also very sexy, to things which are not natural to almost any american male. Just like always, I returned home before every one else at 11:30 but it was a great time. </div><div><br /></div><div>Now I am recuperating of a slow breakfast for the last day of classes this week. (Xelans are celebrating the revolution of the 1940's this week). Tonight I am going to go camping on the top of the volcano of santa maria, and then climb the real monster tajumulco on saturday with Laurel and Thomas. next week will be a week of rest, and I am currently setting trips and volunteer appointments to explore the city/region.</div><div><br /></div><div>Despite all this action, I miss mom and dad a lot. Hehe, just writing this gives rise to goosebumps. Thinking often of megan and especially kate (sorry meg, she's the twin).</div><div><br /></div><div>And for those who need a little electronic entertainment, here is a remix of the super mario theme that I did some push ups to this morning</div><div><br /></div><a href="http://hypem.com/track/1235930/RAC+-+Super+Mario+Bros+RAC+Remix+">http://hypem.com/track/1235930/RAC+-+Super+Mario+Bros+RAC+Remix+</a><div><br /></div><div>Lo que no es dado, es perdido.
