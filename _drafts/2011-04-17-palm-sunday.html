Whew! Hot today, the sun was quite intense. Currently in a town called Bercianos del Camino, where there is a little town bar with rafael nadal vs ferrer on the tube. Trying to decide whether to stay here or continue on the next bigger town. Definitely tired from this morning, but this towns albergue is supposed to be very special. For the moment, it doesn´t matter. I´ve got some granny smith apples from the market and a nice coke to wash down the morning walk.<br /><br />there were tons of people in this bar an hour ago after the service. Basically the entire town went to church and then to the bar. Many walked out surprisingly tipsy for a sunday!
