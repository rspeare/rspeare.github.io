Ok, so the clouds look good today. Hoping for no more rain because yesterday was really tough. Let's hope or the best!<br /><br />Stayed in a great albergue last nosh and watched the king cup soccer game last night with the whole town. Lots of funny comments and a great time. These albergue owners were so nice, very grateful for their hospitality after coming in so cold and wet yesterday. 30km to astorga from here. But of course having trouble separating myself from the free wifi Internet. <br /><br />Thinking of you guys at home.
