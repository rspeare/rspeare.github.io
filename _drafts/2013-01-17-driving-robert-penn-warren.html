<br /><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px;">A few quotes from All the King's Men:</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px;">"Two hours later I was in my car and Burden's Landing was behind me, and the bay, and the windshield wipers were making their busy little gasp and click like something inside you which had better not stop. For it was raining again. The drops swung and swayed down out of the dark into my headlights like a bead portiere of bright metal beads which the car kept shouldering through.</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px;"><br /></div><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px;">There is nothing more alone than being in a car at night in the rain. I was in the car. And I was glad of it. Between one point on the map and another point on the map, there was the being alone in the car in the rain. They say you are not you except in terms of relation to other people. If there weren't any other people there wouldn't be any you because what you do, which is what you are, only has meaning in relation to other people. That is a very comforting thought when you are in the car in the rain at night alone, for then you aren't you, and not being you or anything, you can really lie back and get some rest. It is a vacation from being you. There is only the flow of the motor under your foot spinning that frail thread of sound out of its metal gut like a spider, that filament, that nexus, which isn't really there, between the you which you have just left in one place and the you which you will be when you get to the other place"</div>
