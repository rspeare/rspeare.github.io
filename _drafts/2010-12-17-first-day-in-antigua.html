So left Xela this morning after saying goodbye to the ¨"&" cafe crew. The wrote me a nice note on my knapkin (and they darn well should have since I spent so much time reading and studying there!). Packed a 55pound load into the 65 liter northface backpack, and walked from parque central to the bus terminal in xela. <br /><br />Since I haven´t done this before, I will try to describe a chickenbus experience in more detail.<br /><br />You walk along the terminal as bus conductors, as they usually do, bombard you with names of places in guatemala. Panahachel, Guate, Solola, costa, etc. I repeated Antigua in order to keep conversation short and eventually found a nice empty bus headed for chimaltenango (a very close and very necessary transition spot). Got a nice seat by the window and staked out some serious territory with the bag next to me. Now something that happens with chickenbuses, is that before the bus takes off there is a parade of street vendors and sometimes preachers who walk through bus. Would  you like peanuts? fried chicken? dried plantains or pacaya? a fruit pack? gum? refreshing cola? A piece of advice, it is always a good idea in my opinion to buy a pack of gum, (or at least bring it from a more venerable store) because it helps quite a bit the with the stomach during the ride. <br /><br />The preachers and oratory street vendors are especially interesting, since they normally try to sell you all natural products like ginko juice by giving a discourse on the nervous system, or a cure all for cancer and arthiritis. But they get off the bus about 20 minutes into the trip once you are fairly outside the city. Now the fun starts.<br /><br />Slowly as the bus gets deeper into the country, the initially full chickenbus gets fuller, stacked with indigenous women and their babies along with their harvest, such as onions, rice, corn, or even baby chickens. Now today during my experience, I was slowly asked to place my giant camping bag in between my legs and share a school bus seat with 2 other people. (7 total were in the row). Now this actually wasn´t so bad, because it is actually a good strategy to bring a large bag with you on the bus and sit by the window - it allows you to expand your arms and create a little more space for yourself above the waist. However, there is no chance in hell that your hips and butt will not be plastered up against someone elses. You just hope its a cute or at least polite member of the opposite sex. (I was lucky enough to be next to a nice young woman from the capital). The worst are the children and older indigneous women, they really have no respect for personal space and will be quite rough when finding a place next to you. <br /><br />Mind you while this whole process is going on, the chicken bus is hauling ass down the highway, driving as if it was a bmw convertible through 90 degree turns that hug mountainsides. The views are spectacular of mountainside farms and aldeas, but thats only if you see the window. Also, there are two employees for each chickenbus. the driver of course, who choose the level of insanity of driving as well as the style and decibel level of the music. But, the more interesting trabajador is the tariff collector, who stacks crops and bags on top of the bus while also collecting everyones due on the bus. Now with gringos like me, they often overcharge and lie about price so its a difficult process to explain to them that you are a) not stupid, or b) speak spanish and understood the previous prices for other passengers and asked them about what you SHOULD pay. Aside from this, while the bus is driving 50mph around hairpin turns, this fee collector is often climbing on top of the bus and travelling from front to back. These dudes... are crazy. <br /><br />Now granted, once we arrived in chimaltenango there was a buttload of traffic, and getting out was a major problem. Given that there were at least 10 people standing in the bus aisle already (some of whom were quite obese or with baskets in tow). Getting out with my heavy pack was quite a predicament. Used a lot of "excuse me" to get through the puppy pile of people. <br /><br />Now once in chimaltenango, I actually had to walk a good bit to get to bus for antigua (mostly my fault but I wanted to get the hell off of that bus). Little did I know that the bus to antigua from chimaltenango actually forms a local circuit that always completely stacked full of people. During this 30 minute trip, gracias a dios, I was one of 6 people along the stairwell of the schoolbus. Not to mention there was a nice man shoving his left shoulder directly into my crotch in order to gain more room. One young boy was literally hanging out of the doorway while we went about 40mph. All I could think was, mom would have a heart attack, dad would probably laugh. <br /><br />And... finally arrived in Antigua. The bus terminal is to the west of the city, and looks just like most other chickenbus stops, dirty, chaotic, nerve racking. I immediately bolted east towards the city center and stopped in mcdonalds to recuperate my stomach and spirit. <br /><br />Antigua has the nicest mcdonalds I have ever seen. The view of volcanoe Agua from an outdoor garden, complete with fountains, tables, umbrellas and an awning. Had a nice conversation with a spanish teacher here in Antigua about the best hotels to stay at. Ended up choosing sin verdura for its central and social location. Hopefully megan will enjoy its proximity to the city center, cinema, and a downstairs discoteque. <br /><br />For a moment to moment update, I am sitting here in crazy monkey, or monoloco bar, in a very nice leather chair writing with a beautiful samsung mnitor and dell PC. Feeling comfortable and safe. Went for a nice exploratory run today and flew for the first time in 7 months. Tomorrow might go to Pacaya and look at some lava. <br /><br />Life is good.
