So dropped off Bennie today at he bus station. We had a nice bro hug and a very relaxed goodbye. What a fantastic guy. I have to say though, it's nice to be on my own now. The world seems a little less friendly without a buddy to help you laugh at certain not so nice spaniards, but I can run a bi of a different shedile now. Bennie and I were living a lfe o tv, football, burgers, tapas and beer. Very good times, but I really was getting an ith to go for a run. Such is shared life though, you tend to mixnlifestyles and adapt to each others schedule.<br /><br />After dripping off Bennie and went and rented a bike, then went for a tour around town. Santiago is an incredibly beautiful city. It is very much like Seattle in that it rains a lot, but there are some very GREEN benefits to suh weather. To fill up some time I'm listening to audiobooks and cooking, going to the cathedral and walking around town looming for coffee. Nownits just a countdown till Sunday night, but for now I'll try to enjoy this incredibly difficult life :) I donhave to say, I am a person who struggles without a schedule. It's great to have free time, but too much is not good. <br /><br />Because last night was a but noisy due to some spaniards upstairs, I have joined them tonight. They are drinking wine, smoking, andakong some sort of midnight dinner while I am waiting fornmybarroz con leche to cool and listening to sweet techno beats! This is awesome. <br /><br />Hoping to go or a longer bike ride tomorrow morning and reach the first town to fisterre and then come back home. I could make it to fisterre, but it's not worth the stress at this point. Enough advntures, I'm taking the bus. Sunday will be a nice day trip and then a flight to Paris. Monday and Sunday night will feel very long but it makes the arrival home more valuable. I love that about going tonmammothnlakes California, it takes so long together out there. But once you are it's amazing, it's an odyssey of sorts.<br /><br />Alright off to check on the rice
