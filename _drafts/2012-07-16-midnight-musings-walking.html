Why everyone should walk.<br />--------------------------------------<br />Walking has become my favorite activity over the past 2 years. The experience of walking the Camino de Santiago has planted within me a powerful desire for aimless foot-wandering. Thank goodness Princeton is a safe and walking-friendly place, because without the luxury of walking I would have surely been in some brief (or perhaps not so brief) moments of despair. Many before me have described a love for and benefit from walking: in a somewhat haughty tone such as Thoreau's pedantic analysis of the word 'saunter' and its etymology; or through obsessive, borderline creepy habits such as Ghandi's compulsion to walk up to 10 miles 'briskly' each morning, exhausting many of his female caretakers. I consider myself a moderate walker, not one to go on 20 mile intellectual escapades like Alan Turing or Dirac, but to go out for nightly neighborhood walks (if safety permits).<br /><br />This restless wandering of mine takes place at dusk and so requires a safe and well lit environment - enter princeton. The true magic of the Princeton campus, and main reason for my sentimental attachment to it, lies in a kindness to walkers. Although many do not engage in the practice walking as an autotelic pursuit, choosing instead to haul ass on a thin-tired road bike, or do the arrogantly-rushed-butt-shuffle combined with an overly-public cell phone conversation, or with an intense 'i'm in the middle of texting something very funny or very important countenance', Princeton holds great charms for those walkers who simply do it out of wanderlust.<br /><br />The most salient charm of the 08540 orange bubble is the speciously ancient glow of walkway 'lanterns'. These romantic little black lamposts give a soft glow to any wanderer's path, encouraging him onwards with some strange sort of hypnosis. Their effect falls on all buildings and all blades of grass like some eery fog; it places each stone of McCosh courtyard, each bizzare looking sculpture strewn near Prospect and Cannon green, each residential entryway, into a sentimental light. Their spacing is perfect, in that one who's walking never feels too alone or too crowded by his luminescent company; the walker needs only walk another 20 paces to be alongside the next black lampost-gaurdian, and each one holds his hand along the journey back towards his bed.<br /><br />The second most pleasing thing about walking along Princeton's campus is its rarity. Oh sure, before the reader jumps upon this sleepy-eyed opinion let me justify the previous statement: No one walks in Princeton without an urgent purpose; be it a camera and a family; a cell phone and a pair of stilleto heels; a laptop and a vulnerable research paper pressed between the armpit; or some other great, exceedingly public pursuit. Even to those who are simply walking between classes, it is very obvious that they are only on the path for a finite period of time and are in fact looking forward to getting this temporally inefficient 'walking' over with. This may sound elitist in a way, but it is very true from my own college experience. The only other students I found walking about aimlessly during the daytime or night-time were those 'wierdos' or recently-graduated-still-living-in-Princeton depressed individuals who were facing the consequences of some esoteric theorem or their final clutches to college solipsism. Perhaps I am completely wrong, but if I were to put a guess on the number of people who went out for a walk each day on the Princeton campus who were students, I would say 10 - within a 24-hour period. There of course some variants, such as those who are walking to get exercise (whom I have not included in the approximation), those who are walking to spend time with a significant other (also excised), and those who are walking to think, read, or confront something within themselves. The easily accessible isolation through walking, created by the lack of those who do it, is a great tool for establishing privacy. As many college students know, it can be difficult to disentangle your emotional life from others in the presence of dormitory quads, frat houses, and even libraries which constantly interrupt and occlude the process of introspection. Sure, one can think about oneself while going through the internet pages of news, scouring facebook, or jamming to music while crushing the elliptical amid a hum-drum of so many other desparately-seeking-mental-isolation-while-still-being-productive college students; but all of these options contain a fair amount of distraction and din. The beauty of going for a walk in the orange bubble is that no one expects you to, and like hunkering down in the depressing, obscure bowels of firestone library or the Jadwin catacombs, one can find complete isolation and sonic peace through doing the statistically-unlikely. This type of mental separation, the opportunity to have true privacy, is a valuable commodity and holds great benefit for those who are seeking logical, ethical, or emotional clarity.<br /><br />We as a college generation are so preoccupied with looking 'busy' or 'popular' or 'exciting' during every waking moment of our lives; be it through facebook photos, instagram, or the time-old practice of public posing - see and be seen; that we never take the time to relax and indulge in some 'me' time. Yes, we are the 'me' generation, but we hardly follow that title appropriately; we live for the desires, wants, and projection of others, without any heed or careful ear to the stirrings of our own hearts. This habit, of looking busy and being self-centered in some strange projecting and perverted sort of way, is what kills the prospect of going for a walk. After all, who has time when there so many other 'instant' or cyber-display oriented things to do? What a&nbsp;colossal, boring way to spend one's day! But, this blog poster, who is dealing with some quasi-existential crises due to the recent unveling of the undergraduate bib, would argue that walking holds great currency for the 'me' generation - it allows one to effusively, ardently, honestly, get in touch with the inner 'me'.<br /><br />I hope the reader, (ahem family members) aren't too appalled at reading this (for those who haven't been drooling out the side of the mouths in boredom and been snatched away by some other internetz-ephemeral attraction); so, I would like to finish with a comic anecdote before heading to bed - hopefully to finish these thoughts another restless night: there is nothing better than a cold, crisp, excoriatingly sour wawa granny smith apple - particularly as a footnote to a nightly walk. I absolutely love the feeling of a cold green orb between my fingers amid the warm bath of summer air. I love the sound of that first bite into a granny smith, when all the porous compartments of the outer layers break down like collapsing styrofoam or cardboard. I love the sugary spit that a granny smith concocts, and the borderline painful maxillofacial feeling you take to bed knowing that: one, your mouth has been thoroughly excercised and stimulated in its chomping capacities and two, your teeth have just been residually, irreconcilably corroded via the low PH of that shamelessly acidic fruit. Herein lies the guilt of a granny smith and its main indulgent appeal; that, just like pineapple, it has the exceedingly sharp taste of an artificial sour patch candy or warhead or gobstopper; the type of insanely sugar-infused candy that is deemed only fit for immature young boys under the age of seven. I love satisfying this childish taste for dangerous sweetness, the 'oh god I know its not good for my teeth but it's so sweet and awesome' type of food, towards which we all have a sinful proclivity. Like orange juice for many slow-morning-wakers, or pineapple for the meat enthusiasts, we all have our inner-borderline-insane-child sweet tooth, and what better way to quell this desire with a cold piece of simple fruit on a hot summer night - amid a walk to boot. That being said, brushing one's teeth afterwards proves to be a problematic and often cathartic process - like going to confession 5 minutes after committing the sin.<br /><br />
