So a few basic UNIX commands with examples. I hope this helps the common man understand how to get around the bash shell and a Mac's directory system.<br /><br />Let's start with how the computer is structured. First, everything starts from the root ( / ). This is the ultimate anchor point for all directories on your hard drive. Stored in the root directory are a bunch of different folders/directories that are vital to your operating system. Below the root is the USERS directory, which contains all the user accounts on the computer. For most home PC's and laptops there is only the admin account (the guy with all the access privileges) or the one that you created first when booting up the operating system. There is also a guest account, and the shared account where public files are stored.<br /><br />Normally when you boot up the bash shell or even MS-DOS, you are started in your User directory. So for example my username is rob, so on start-up I am placed in the following directory: /Users/rob (forward slash separates directory levels)<div><br /></div><div>So, if your on a Mac, start up the terminal application. (The .app file is stored in your Utilities folder, or you can simply type "terminal" into spotlight, which is a great finder tool at the top right of your screen. On start-up you will see a display with your username and then a $ symbol. For example</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>user$ "enter commands in here"</div><div>Now type "pwd" and press enter. This displays your current working directory (or your location in the computers file system).</div><div><br /></div><div>Wanna move around? First you need to know where to go! To list the working directory contents, or the subfolders type:</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>user1$ "ls"</div><div>The ls command lists files, folder, docs, etc in the current directory. Now, if you want to move into a subfolder named "folder1" type:</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>user1$ cd folder1</div><div>This tells the computer to change directory (cd) to the specified folder. However, we are essentially moving downwards in the file system and will eventually hit a dead end. If you want to move upwards in the directory system you need to type:</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>user1$ cd ..</div><div>The .. means "the folder above" the one your working in now.</div><div><br /></div><div>Example:</div><div>Start terminal</div><div><br /></div><div>rob$ pwd</div><div>/Users/rob</div><div>rob$ ls</div><div>Documents<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">  </span>Pictures</div><div>Movies<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">   </span>Desktop</div><div>Public <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">   </span>Music</div><div>... (it goes on)</div><div>rob$ cd Music</div><div>rob$ pwd</div><div>/Users/rob/Music</div><div>rob$ cd .. ; pwd<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">   </span>(this separates two commands into one line, to be executed sequentially left to right)</div><div>/Users/rob</div><div>rob$ cd .. ; pwd</div><div>/Users</div><div>rob$ cd .. ; pwd</div><div>/</div><div><br /></div><div>Alright now you know how to get around the file system. Make sure to move around check out all the folders on your computer! </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><div><br /></div><div><br /><br /><br /><br />cd (change directory)</div></div>
