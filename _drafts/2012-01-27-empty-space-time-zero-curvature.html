Very minute point in one of our problem sets which I'm having trouble with so I'll therapeutically write it out.<div><br /></div><div>When Einstein released his field equations there was a rush of solutions presented by different physicists who wanted to encapsulate the entire universe into one equation. One of the presented models is called the Milne Cosmology, which is based off of Minkowski Coordinates, or a flat space time. </div><div><br /></div><div>In flat space time, the space time interval and proper time are measured with the following metric:</div><div><br /></div><div>d(s)^2 = -dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2</div><div><br /></div><div>This is called minkowski space-time, where the affine connection coefficients, Riemman Curvature Tensor and Ricci Tensor all equal 0. Zero curvature implies an empty space time, so this is a cosmological model that requires an empty space-time, or no density of matter, radiation, etc in the universe. </div><div><br /></div><div>Now what makes Milne's cosmology so tricky is that he adopts a clever coordinate transformation:</div><div>t = tau * cosh(x)</div><div>x = tau * sinh(x) * sin(theta) * sin(phi)</div><div>y = tau * sinh(x) * sin(theta) *cos(phi)</div><div>z = tau * sinh(x) * cos(theta)</div><div><br /></div><div>Now if you notice, -t^2 + x^ + y^2 + z^2 = tau^2; so our minkowski space-time is still satisfied. What is strange here, is that to observers, one at x = 0, and one at x = x_0, will think that they are moving away from eachother. Specifically you can show that the velocity observed by the person at x = 0, watching a friend at x = x_0 will be :</div><div><br /></div><div>(d/dt)(x^2+y^2+z^2)^1/2=(d/dtau)(dtau/dt)(x^2+y^2+z^2)^1/2=tanh(x_0)</div><div><br /></div><div>Or, they will assume that the universe is expanding. This is NOT true however, because if space-time is flat then it is empty, and therefore there is no source of 'pressure' to expand. Milne's cosmology is a clever coordinate system where things appear to be expanding, but this is not true. </div><div><br /></div><div>Our problem set dealt with what's called a cosmological redshift in its last problem. This is essentially the stretching of photon wavelengths along with the Universe's dimensions - As space expands so do wavelengths. It was a trick question, because in a Milne Cosmology, there is NO cosmological redshift because there is no expansion.</div>
