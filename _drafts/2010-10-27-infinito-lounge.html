So last night, I went to this really cool hippy bar called infinito lounge. It is basically a bar with vegeterian fare, relaxed seating and live music every tuesday night, here is a video of a really great saxophone player doing a improvised line over 'blue moon'. Not sure how the sound quality will turn out, but it was a great atmosphere, sitting there with cristian and friends. <div><br /></div><div>Most of chrisitan friends were gay, and i think there is a very tight gay community in xela. I don't have the experience or perspective to speculate; however, there is a lot of 'machismo' in latin america just like the US, and therefore it makes sense that the gay members of society search each other out when families or 'vecindarios' can't understand. </div><div><br /></div><div>To describe the situation behind this video in words, I was seated by the window surrounded by some very energetic guatemaltecos who were practicing their english with me while I was replying in spanish, a very comical situation to watch. I had just finished studying and eating a delicious and spicy cream of vegetable soup, sitting there with a glass of water completely relaxed. I get a lot of strange looks from guatemaltecos in bar situations when i don't drink or smoke.(mi respuesta siempre es 'disculpame pero casi nunca bebo cerveza'). Therefore, I am very popular with guatemalan women and mothers because they think I am a very straight arrow, however the younger ones think I am very religious and aceitic. </div><div><br /></div><div>It is amazing how crosscultural music can be. No matter where you are from, how much money you have, or when you were born, there is always an ability (given the desire) to create incredible music. Just like my friend that I met the other day who travelled 6 hours every saturday to study guitar, this concert was another example of the ubiquitious passion of music in every culture, every corner of humanity. Why do we feel this inherent need to express ourselves through music? Because sometimes language will never be good enough, no matter how beautiful or complex the pronuncation (french), symbolic and artistic the system (chinese), metaphoric and efficient (spanish), or verbose and articulate (english) - nuestros sentimientos fueron hecho en una manera lejos de palabras, somos seres de luz y sonido. </div><div><br /></div><div>Talked to kate, mom and dad last night. Kate is busy as always but giddy about her job offer; mom and dad were chilling watching ncis. Missing and loving all you guys, (you too meg)</div><div><br /></div><div>Estoy vivo, estoy viviendo!Ta</div>
