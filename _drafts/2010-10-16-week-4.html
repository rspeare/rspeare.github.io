Whew. So I have sleeping like a baby recently. With the freedom of my own schedule, the last couple nights have been filled with tv, hot chocolate and 10 hour sleeping marathons. Woke up this morning almost at noon after going to bed at 10am, really dont understand why i sleep so much sometimes. But, i am going to turn over a new leaf and try to create a more rigid schedule to be more producctive.
