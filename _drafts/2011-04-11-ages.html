Okay, so one day outside of burgos now. Hanging out in another spanish bar. There´s news, drinks, and the bartenders children being yelled at to help out with the bar cleaning of tabels and what not. <br /><br />Todays walk was very isolated in the woods. We climbed up to about 1200m and then there was nothing for about 12km. Nowhere to sit and rest, not to mention cold and rainy. Francoise (my french compatriot=) loved it. however, I did not. But I think this is the part of the camino that is a little tough. The sheer magnitude of the distance is setting in as we reach the halfway point. <br /><br />Luckily the body is holding up great. 22km is about my comfort zone now, and I have learned what pace works best for these legs and these feet. have had absolutely now blisters (knock on wood), thank goodness. Left knee/leg has healed up great and now just as strong as the right.<br /><br />the run yesterday was absolutely fantastic, such a beautiful countryside to run in. If I was a spanish professional runner I would simply run up and down the camino all day long with a touring bus alongside. Unfortunately, I find that running makes me an impatient walker the next day. Todays walk seemed slow in comparison to last nights excitement.<br /><br />Looking forward to getting to burgos and checking out a bigger city. Unfortunately, the iphone charger broke today and I am now out of an mobile electronic connection to the outside world. So, hopefully there will be some tienda where such device can be found!<br /><br />Had a very nice, or at least interesting dinner tonight. The owner of the restaurant was an old woman who obviously loved pilgrims, and served us this sweet wine with pepper before dinner. We then, had three courses... i had salad, fish, and banana dessert. None of which was incredible. But at the end, she gave out these little pastry cups that she but orange wine inside. We each had a small sip of the wine just to taste it,and then threw the pastry and all into the mouth. It was very interesting. She then proceeded to ask each of us why we were on the camino.The night finished with the check, a hug, and a kiss for each one of us. Very nice.<br /><br />Interactions like this surely make some very uncomfortable, but i think its part of the camino, and of life. Its important to be patient and listen (sometimes) to those who want to tell you something thats important to them, because one day it may be very important to you. <br /><br />tonight at dinner we talked about the college atmosphere in the united states. It seems to be completely different from that of australia and europe in some ways. And very similar in others. Although, I have to say that I didn´t get much infromation from the australian girl whom I ahve been spending time with, she is a bit of a closed book at the moment. Such is life on the camino though, sometimes people reveal very piercing and essential parts of themselves, whereas for the majority, they are quite guarded in a constantly changing social atmosphere. <br /><br />Walked with a nice spanish man today, who is a camino veteran. he has a rhinocerous head carved into his walking stick... pretty bad ass. Seems like a nice man, who really just enjoys to walk alone. I respect that quite a bit. It takes a special personality to truly enjoy travelling alone. Francoise for instance is having a great time away from her husband and family. Something that i find hard to understand. however, some of these lone travelers are only spending 2 weeks away from home. It is much different than a month or multiple month commitment to being on your own.
