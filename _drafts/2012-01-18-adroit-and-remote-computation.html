Very exciting stuff today!<div><br /></div><div>I  have finally gotten an adroit remote computation account up and working from my macbook! Now I can use up 64 separate cpu's and 128 GB of ram!!! Holy crap, this is a big step up from the 2GB, dual core processor on this laptop. Whew!</div><div><br /></div><div>Not gonna lie, setting up remote computation accounts via VisIt wasn't that easy. But hey, it could be way worse. Their GUI helps a lot, and the pre-determined config files for Princeton users is pretty sweet.</div>
