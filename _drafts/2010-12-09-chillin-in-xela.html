Strange but sweet lyrics;<br />Crave You by Flight Facilities<br />I walked into the room dripping in Gold<br />a wave of heads did turn, or so I´ve been told<br />my heart broke when i saw you kept your gaze controlled<br /><br />Why can´t you want me like the other boys do?<br />They stare at me while I stare at you.<br />Why cant I keep you safe as my own<br />One moment I have you and the next your gone<br /><br />we have steps on an empty stage<br />that boys got my heart in a silver cage<br />why can´t you want me like the other boys do?<br />they stare me while I crave you<br /><br />Let´s just stop and think<br />before I lose face<br />surely I can´t fall <br />into a game of chess<br /><br />around his little finger that boy has got me tied<br />I try to reach out but he...<br />this boys got my head tied in knots with all his games<br />is simply want him because he looks the other way<br /><br />we have steps on an empty stage<br />that boys got my heart in a silver cage<br />why can´t you want me like the other boys do?<br />they stare me while I crave you<br /><hr/><br /><p style="color:chartreuse"><br />Color set by using rgb value... haha figured out how to set colors manually using html code cool stuff.<br /></p><br /><br />Okay
