Our Hostels were full these 3 days (monday tuesday wednesday), so we decided to take a trip back to Lago Atitlan (lake Atitlan). As to explain the photos, 2 are from a nighttime walk up baul to overlook the Xela lights, and others are from our trip to San pedro.<div><br /></div><div>Getting over here was a little interesting, thomas really wanted to be the negotiator on the way over, and unfortunately I didn't trust some of his decisions since the conversations weren't that long. But, we survived and made to the main country bus station in the west call encuentros, which actually is just a huge meeting of 3 roads. we then took a bus to san jorge, then rode on the back of a pick up truck with 13 other indigenous people all speaking dialects like (Kiche don't know the spelling and Soc ah ah). Then we took a boat to cross the lake and arrived at about 4:30. I went for a run and we had a nice dinner once again at our favorite place zoolah. </div><div><br /></div><div>Yesterday we climbed up San Pedro volcanoe. it was interesting taking the took took (small tricycle cab popular in bangkhok) up to the park entrance. I went up to a took took and asked how much, the little bastard told me 20Q per person. So I hesitated and said that's really expensive. Then he said "Que dices" what do you say? I said 10 for the both of us. He said no and acted really offended. Luckily tom was right behind us bartering with another guy who offered 5 per person. </div><div><br /></div><div>So, we hopped on and started our way up the mountain, talking to our driver clemente about his family. He was very proud of his father, who is the only Mayan shaman left in san pedro, he gives ceremonies all over the world. </div><div><br /></div><div>We said goodbye to clemente and went to the park entrance. 3 guys were just hanging out there and told that it cost 100Q per person to climb the mountain. How ridiculous is that?! We were very surprised and told the entrance people that that was way too much. However, they showed all this paperwork and showing that everybody else had payed 100Q. So Tom and I talked and decided to go climb another mountain. But, of course on our way out the guys chased us down and said "Que dices" how much would you like to pay? We diddn't want to be real dicks, so we just said give us the local/guatemalan rate which is 50Q per person. (even this is ridiculous to walk up a mountain). So we gave em the money, and I think they really appreciated the fact that I could talk and joke with them. One of the guys decided to even go with us and guide us through through the first 20 minutes because there it is the easiest to get lost. (on the way up he taught some more dialect phrases native to san pedro but "thank you" was ridiculously hard")</div><div><br /></div><div>We said goodbye to the guide and he told us we had about 2hours left to hike, 1:30 if we hiked really fast. But, given how competitive  Tom and I are, we summited in 45 minutes. (Felt like real badasses at the top). Unfortunately I had some really bad groin/knee pain, probably due to a weak sartorius/stabilizing muscle with my hiking boots. Thank god, we met some nice young travelers from spain one of which had some awesome (non-fake) ibuprofen pills. After 2 pills I felt great and was able to get back down very easily. Once we got back, Tom and I crashed, played poker online, studied spanish, and had dinner. it was a great day.</div><div><br /></div><div>Today we are heading out to Kayak.</div>
