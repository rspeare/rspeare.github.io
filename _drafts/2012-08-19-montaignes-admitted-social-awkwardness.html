I was reading Montaigne's "On Presumption" today and stepped on this little gem:<br /><br />"Now, as for me, I prefer to be awkward and indiscreet rather than to flatter and dissemble. I confess that there is an element of pride and stubbornness in remaining open and all of a piece, with no consideration for others, and it seems to me that I become a little too free when I least outh to be so and that I react to the duty of respect by growing more heated. It may also be for lack of art I just follow my nature. When I use then that same liberty of tongue and expression that I bring to my household, I feel how much it sinks towards a lack of discretion and rudeness. But apart from the fact that I made that way, <i>my wit is not supple enough to dodge a sudden question and to escape down some side-road, nor to pretend that something is true. My memory is not good enough to remember that pretence nor reliable enough to maintain it: so I act the brave out of weakness."</i><br /><i><br /></i>Obviously, Mr. Michel thinks himself a social misfit. At least in the realm of quick wit and humor, he feels inadequate and unable to keep pace with -- possibly more charming -- male adversaries. I empathize with Montaigne on this point because there have so been so many social interactions in my life where I have chosen to follow the simple road; to act serious or ominous out of fear; to purposefully bring the rhythm of talk down to a more pedestrian, possibly somber pace. Kate, of course, would give me a tough time for employing such a tactic: but we are all guilty of becoming "removed", "silent", or "downtrodden" in the face of exceedingly gregarious antagonists. Just like a dog with its tail tucked between its legs, a person who feels outside of the comedy will resort to sulking - or interpolating high brow remarks.<br /><br />Typical of someone who reads many books but does not enjoy much face time with other human beings, Montaigne must have struggled with the higher pace of "light" conversation. I can imagine him stirring in the corner, thinking only of Latin verses or strange references to antiquity, possibly thoughts of philosophy while others played and stretched much lighter topics. Poor Michel :( I feel for you buddy.
