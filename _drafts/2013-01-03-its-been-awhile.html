His dad's tights from the 70's. Boy are they tight. Still fit though. Gloves? check. Hat? eh. Sneakers? A bit old, but it's only a few miles. I've forgotten how to do this.<br /><br />Tip toe across an ice crusted brick walkway. Down the driveway at a trot. Hop to it now! One Two One Two. It's been awhile.<br /><br />Cold, clean air burns the roof of his mouth and stings his nipples tonight. A headwind revives the old itchy forehead, singeing cheeks and chilly migraine-- PV=NRT, discrepant temperature leads to discrepant cephalic pressure, headache: it's redolent sensory overload. His stride is choppy but bouncy. Jaunty. Well rested. Like some linebacker high stepping it in for the touchdown -- too many squats. No more biking, those quads have gotten so big. But, the new power feels good; he wonders if he could&nbsp;out sprint&nbsp;his springy sixteen-year-old self. How many miles has he slogged out here in the bitter wind? amongst other boys at frigid dusk, when parents race home from work in droves, practically sweeping him and the team off of the sidewalk.<br /><br />Snowballs ahead. Four young boys. Each clothed with a puffiness that is proportional to a mother's love. They cross their arms in front of their crotches and sheepishly look up, restraining the snowball carrying wrist with an admonishing opposite mitten. He smiles. Says hi. <i>Hey</i>. Cute kids.<br /><br />Lambent deer and left over Christmas trees light his way. Snow covered rooftops with struggling bulbs, glimmering just beneath the white powder. More driveways. More children. More families.<br /><br />Land ends. Up the gravel trail onto a snow mottled field. The grass crunches beneath each step. He is leaping into the dark. Each stride is an act of faith. His eyes adjust and he sees the old Track ahead with an open gate; that ol' sticky red tarmac. Turning again. Leaning left. Running hard on this open ground. "And he's winning the NCAA 10,000meter championship ladies and gentleman! Looking very strong as he separates from the field!" On your toes now. Quick steps. Baby Jesus in a cardboard manger along with a few other sanctimonious mannequins pay witness to his triumph.<br /><br />Streaking down the straightaway, leaning through the tape, he stops and gasps into an orange sky: clouds lit up from the west. California. Where he used to train. He's grown up so much. Heavier body, lighter mind. Interests have changed, more incisive. Steadier. Why? Cosmic Validation? Who knows, too much Updike. The orange sky is hers, with her full moon. It's been so long.<br /><br />Git' back home now. Hop to it. Hips swinging side to side in forgetful fatigue. Try to run smooth and straight. Lurking dark ice at street corners, beautiful street lamps. Penumbra. Not like the city where no tasteful darkness can be found. Watching his own shadow, engaging that old out of control narcissism; when he used to stare into car windows at his own reflection, carving those cheekbones into a macabre mien. Melancholy manifest. Intensity.<br /><br />Watching that rickety stride, the left knee turning in ever so slightly; slowly destroying his joints. Fuck it. Let him fly, for now.<br /><br />Construction site ahead. Why do bulldozers gobble up our childhood? It will be a nice school for some future boy, to steal a kiss behind the monkey bars--the elementary tryst.<br /><br />Fleeing from car lights like a deer, crossing the street in quiet haste; he must get home to his shower, warmth, mom, dinner. Thank god it's a net descent to the house. Up the driveway, jog to a stop. Careful crepitating over the walkway, once again. Through the back door. Safe.<br /><br />The post run wheeze. Itchy feet. The race to the shower: frantic undressing, red skin. Lobster thighs and gooseflesh. Steam, wonderful steam... Ahhhh....<br /><br />It's been awhile.
