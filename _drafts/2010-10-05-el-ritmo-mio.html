So, here is a typical day for roberto.<div>630am wake up and go for a walk or run... or sleep in till 730</div><div>eat breakfast with jovita, normalmente milk sugar and oatmeal, or scrambled eggs and black beans with tortillas. and of course lots of coffee and tea.</div><div>Walk to school about 10 minutes to get to class around 800am. study with my maestra lucia (just us two) talking, reviewing and sometimes walking through the city practicing speaking in different tenses. take a break at 1030 with the other students to drink tea and coffee sometimes dipping coffee or bread. return to class at 11 until 100pm, when i return to my casa to almorzar (have lunch) with jovita. normalmente arroz con vegetales, come tamales or eggplant parmesean, soup. go back to school for the afternoon trip at 230, or if the trip is no t appealing, i walk up the mountain to the south to the pedrera school to work with little ninos, teaching english and math for 2 hours. Then, i hike back down the mountain to my house. During the night, i either walk around the city, go for a run, or go to a boxing club. Go back home to have a light dinner, and to bed shortly thereafter, talking with one of jovitaÂ´s sons. by 11pm i am asleep in my sleeping bag (still need to buy earplugs because of these darn stray dogs). </div><div><br /></div><div>this... is a great life</div>
