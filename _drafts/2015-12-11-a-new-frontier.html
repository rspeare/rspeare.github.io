<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I was very sad to leave the NYU Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics last month. Said goodbye to many good friends and a very special advisor.<br /><br />But now, onto new things. After leaving the Physics world, it is time to brush up on more practical aspects of mathematics and analysis. As a note to self -- and, enthusiastic advertisement to friends interested and working on the same things -- I'll put the following as the next focal points of this blog:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Linear (integer and mixed) Programming and the Simplex Method</li><li>Hadoop and Distributed File Systems</li><li>Spark</li><li>Unsupervised Machine Learning methods galore</li></ul><div>There is currently a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/santas-stolen-sleigh">kaggle</a>&nbsp;competition being hosted by FICO, which tries to optimize Santa's delivery of packages. Very interesting problem and very nice opportunity to learn new things.&nbsp;</div></div>
