Here is a dense tidbit from 'Infinite Jest' by David Foster Wallace about tennis:<br /><br />"One of the reasons the late James Incandenza had been so terribly high on bringing Schtitt to E.T.A was that SChtitt like the founder himself (who'd come back to tennis, and later film, from a background in hard-core-mathbased optical science), was the Schitt approached competitive tennis more like a pure mathematician than a technician. Most jr.-tennis coaches are basically technicians, hands on practical straight-ahead problem-solving statistical-data wonks, with maybe added knacs for short-haul psychology and motivational speaking. The about not cruncihing serious stats is that SChtitt had clued Incandenza in, all the way back at a B.S 1989 USTA convention on photo-electric line judging, that he, Schtitt, knew real tensnis was really about not the blend of statistical order and expansive potential that the game's technicians rever, but in fact the opposit - NOT-order, LIMIT, the places where things broke down, fragmented in beauty. That real tennis was no more reducible to delimited factors or probability curves than chess or boxing, the two games of which it's a hybrid.In short, SChtitt and the tall AEC-optics man (i.e. Incandenza), whose fierce flat serve and haul-ass-to-the-net approach to the game had carried him through MIT on a full ride w/ stipend, and hwose consulting report on high-speed photoelectric tracking the USTA mucky-mucks found dense pas all comprehending, found themselves totally simpatico on tennis's exemption from stats-tracking regression. Were he now still among the living Dr. Incandenza would now describe tennis in the paradoxical terms of whats now called 'Extra-Linear Dynamics'. And Schtit, whose knowledge of formal math is probably about equivalent to that of a Taiwanese kndergartner, nevertheless seemed to know what Hopman and van der Meer and Bollettieri seemed not to know: that locating beauty and art and magic and improvement and keys to excellence and victory in the prolix flux of match play is not a fractal matter of reducing caos to pattern. Seemed intuitively to sense that it was a matter not of reduction at all, but- perversely - of expansion, thealeatory flutter of unctonrolled, metastatic growth - each well-shot ball admitting of n possible responses, n squared possible response to those responses, and on into what Incandeza would articulate to anyone who shared both his backgrounds as a Cantorian continuum of infinities of possible move and response, Cantorian and beautiful because infliating, contained, this diagnate infinity of infinities of choice and execution, mathematically uncontrolled but humanly contained, bounded by the talent and imagination of self and opponent, bent in on itself by the containing boundaries of skill and imagination that brought on player finally down, that kept both from winning, that made it, finally, a game, these boundaries of self...<br /><br />And then also, again, still, what are thsoe boundaries, if they're not baselines, that contain and direct its infinite expansion inward, that make tennis like chess on the run, beautiful and infinitely dense?... The true opponent, the enfolding boundary is the player himself. Always and only the self out there, on court to be met, fought, brought to the table to hammer out terms. The competing boy on the net's other side: he is not the foe: he is more the partner in the dance. he is that what is the word excuse or occasion for meeting the self. As you are his occasion. Tennis's beauty's infinite roots are self competitive. You compete with you own limits to transcend the self in imagination and execution. disappear inside the game: break through the limits: transcend: improve: win. Which is why tennis is an essentially tragic enterprise, to improve and grow as a serious junior, with ambitions. You seek to vanquish and transcend the limited self whose limits make the game possible in the first place. It is tragic and sad and chaotic and lovely. All life is the same, as citizens of the human State: the animating limits are within, to be kill and mourned over and over again."
