Topology as defined by wikipedia: an area of mathematics that focuses on properties conserved under continuous deformations of objects. This would be smearing, stretching, twisting, etc. But NOT tearing or gluing. <br /><br />Many people have set forth theories about the topology of the universe. Some involve cell structure theories, where the universe is supposed to be a series of expanding cell walls that consist of highly dense bodies. Another theory describes our universe as divided into hierarchical clusters, or isolated heavily dense spherical clusters spaced within it. <br /><br />This is all very abstract and very hard to understand without some background, so I'll tell you about what I've learned so far. <br /><br />According to Professor Gott, if the initial conditions of our universe were determined by a gaussian distribution (probability), and the formation of clusters and superclusters were due entirely to LINEAR gravitational forces, then the initial distribution/topology should be preserved. Now supposedly, the non-linear effects of gravity are only now starting to come into effect in the areas of space that we can observe, meaning that data should still represent the initial topology of the universe. <br /><br />After analyzing data from the CfA survey, a study that uses gravitational redshifts to determine the separation distance between us and other galaxies, Professor Gott found that our universe shows a 'sponge-like' topology. Meaning that, given a critical density that splits our space into high (black) and low (white) regions, we see that all high density regions are multiply connected. There are NO isolated bodies. Even more interesting, is the fact that you can switch the density criteria and change all high density areas to low, low to high, and the image looks exactly the same (as long as each took up 50% of the 3-d image). <br /><br />There are theoretical reasons for this type of topology which have to do with quantum fluctuation involving random phase (Zeldovich). Something that I haven't read into yet.<br /><br />But, by analyzing this spongelike topology and breaking it down using Gaussian curvature, genus and other mathematical tools, one can guess the number of 'holes' in each volume of space. This allows you to approximate even further lengths out into space! <br /><br />Next post will be on something called gaussian curvature.
