OK, so had a great day in Xela. Spent the morning outside, read lots of Harry Potter in spanish. But now, its time for some computer factoids!<br /><br />What the heck is a kernel?<br />The absolute most important thing in any operating system. It is the juggler of all the requests that we give the computer! It decides which program gets to access the cpu, and answers requests from outside inputs such as the keyboard and input devices. The kernelis basically the first level of "abstraction" of your computers raw metal self. For instance, back in the day in the 1960s nobody used kernels, and because of that the computer failed many times, because there was no intermediary to set up some rules of use of the computers resources. Kernels are also used for protection because many college students in the 60s used to hack into computer cpu units so they could get more computing time without paying for it... lol! <br /><br />Nowadays kernels represent the physical parts of the computers with "abstractions" such as memory stored files that can be written into. For example if you transfer the file myresume.txt into the printer file, it gets printed. <br /><br />So, to emphasize... the kernel is basically the most important thing in an operating system. It is the nanny of all running software programs and therefore protects your computer from breaking down.<br /><br />So here is something really, really cool about the difference between Mac OSX, windows and linux - the three most popular operating systems. They each use differently designed kernels!!! One of the main differences is that they each multitask differently. For example, when your surfing the net and playing music, writing and word document, and whatever else. Your kernel is actually handling all of those program requests and parsing a certain amount of time to each one to the cpu, or the engine that processes these programs. Windows uses a priority like scheme, which gives certain programs first dibs on the cpu in order to execute its instruction. Normally, short programs and easier requests are given preference over others. THe priority list has exactly 32 spots. Linux has over 100 spots for a similar preference list. Mac is completely different in that it parses cpu time equally to all programs without preference. This offers advantages for programming ease and operation safety, but can sacrifice efficiency by "waiting" too much for larger requests to fill up cpu time.<br /><br />ooops! gotta go... until next time
