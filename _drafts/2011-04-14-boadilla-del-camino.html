Now in bed at a place called boadilla del camino listening to Darwin dees. Had a tough walk today because of a very isolated final stretch. Intensely missing home, but such is traveling. It is amazing how you have about two weeks of adrenaline to deal with all sorts of new challenges and stimuli eholenim a fewign country. Them hat high wears off and you begin to search for a rhythm, or at least the comfort of consistency in your daily life.<br /><br />I find myself intensely attached to certain pilgrim comforts such as the daily shower, the morning espresso, and the comfort of good company. Unfortunately these are not always available. Certain pilgrims such as my friends Toby jim Jessica evan and Maria will come and go. We are all on different schedules. Even outpacing these people today And ending up in a different albergue tonight has me upset, but you find comfort with new company or good food and bed. <br /><br />The mentally and emotionally successful pilgrim:<br />-realizes that there is a difference between what is wanted, and what is needed. (shower, food, shelter. Yup that's about it)<br />-is patient for good things to come. (be it 1k or 16k till next civilization, 10min or 7 hours till your next meal, it is all just a matter of time)<br />-accepts the great boredom that is the human condition. There are no tigers to run from, the necessities of survival are readily available, so what do you decide to do with your time? The dilemma of free choice. <br /><br />Today was tough, but I'm ready for the mesera. It's goin to be boring and possibly quote unomortable at times. But what don't kill ya makes ya stronger!
