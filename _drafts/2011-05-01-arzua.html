Had a nice walk with benny today. Went about 29k to a place calles arzua. Currently in a pretty loud bar pulling down wifi. It's funny, but sometimes pilgrimsnare not recieved well by townspeople. I understand of course, but as Benny says "if you don't want pilgrims<br />To come in then why did you post a a big sign that says pilgrims menu?" Benny and I just entered a<br />Pizzeria where everyone went quiet after our entrance. <br /><br />The days in Galicia have been really nice. Cool<br />Cloudy mornings followed by afternoon thundershowers. Looking forward to arriving at the sea. <br /><br />Oh dear, just a caught a bad stare from some Spanish man, sheesh!<br /><br />Well, life is good here. Can't wait to come home to you all.
