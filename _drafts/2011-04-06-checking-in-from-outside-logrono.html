Hey there, <br />So quick update. Had a great walk yesterday but might have had too much energy. Ran up some hills just from impatience, and when i woke up from an afternoon nap. The left knee was hurting. So, slept all day ate well and took it easy today.<br /><br />Now outside of logrono in a gorgeous city. More pictures and videos coming because I just found an iPhone charger!!!!! HAhahahahahah yes. Also found some sweet protein bars and almonds. I´m all set to do some damage tomorrow (safely, of course).<br /><br />In the hostel now with a very young crowd. There are some cousins from texas and arizona who are about 27. A nice german girl who I walked all day with today. A young colombian guy with a real sweet bulldog along for the camino. Nice to be with people closer to my age group. <br /><br />Missing you guys at home. Almost everyday I think about what kate, megan, mom and dad are doing and I realize you´re all in bed. Except for Joan actually, she may be out and about. <br /><br />Saw some really beautiful dogs today. One guy had a sweet mohawk, and his dog did too. Very funny.<br /><br />Been on the camino for a week now and some things have changed. 22km of walking really doesn´t feel like very much anymore. When you see a sign that says 6km to go, you think oh man almost there! just one more hour. Got a haircut (although it was a disaster). The hairdresser tried to posh me up by cutting the hair with the shag cutters.... oh well hair grows. The feet feel much better these days. i dunno if the plantar fascia are stronger or if my bone density has gone up but its great. Definitely getting some hiker legs too. Very tan calves, although it could be from all the dirt. Continuing to adapt to all the snoring in these albergues. But I have to admit, I have been dreaming very intensely for some reason. It´s pretty awesome. <br /><br />Missing you all back home. Kate and Meg, we should go on a hike together this spring on the appalachain trail. That would be awesome.<br /><br />Mom dad, just heard from drexel about the internship... no bones :(
