Yesterday morning headed out at 8 o clock for lago atitlan. After a very cramped car ride to the bus station, and yet another 2 hour bus ride in the mountains with tons of turns. My stomach has adapted to the type of driving involved in this country. Once we arrived at lago atitlan, we decided to go to a place called san pedro. So, taking a small boat across the lake for 30 minutes we arrived in the secondary hippie central of guatemala.<br /><br />I have never seen such a beautiful town. Each house is directly over the water and the lake is surrounded by volcanoes. The land is truly astonishing. We checked into a hotel for 8 dollars a night which is amazing and then laurel and I went out for a run to explore. AFter coming back we walked around the town for a while, until our guide cristian wanted to show us his favoriote place in san pedro.<br /><br />It is an israeli owned hotel slash restaurant that is incredibly relaxed. The seating area for the restaurant was absolutely beautiful and the food was amazing. However, it is definitely a center for pot smokers or people who are maybe overly relaxed, pictures coming soon. We hung out there all night basically until going to a bar and then talking on a roof while watching a fire dancer and looking at some stars. Tomas and I talked a lot about religion and his experience with mormonism, hinduism, and his year in thailand. Very good night, woke up this morning for a walk and now IÂ¨m in an internet cafe overlooking the water and mountains. PIctures coming soon...
