OK, so after trying for an hour to access the real articles of Wikileaks through mirror websites, I have failed. The US has truly put all of their resources towards shutting down this organization. This actually upsets me, because I would like to see these cables for myself instead of gulping down the opinions of french, spanish, latin american writers, etc. <br /><br />Bah humbug
