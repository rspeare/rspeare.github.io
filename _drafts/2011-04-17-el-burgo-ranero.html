Alright, so did an extra 8km this afternoon around 5 o clock to get a late arrival in El Burgo Ranero. After talking with kate over skype, had the energy to keep on a little further and I am so glad I did. Found julia at the next place along with a nice supermarket (very rare on a sunday). Then had a nice dinner of pasta, ice cream, and tea and cookies. Feeling much better now that I´m in some good company. Met up with the girl from oregon again too, her name is christina by the way, we got to catch up a bit and talked about the meaning of palm sunday and semana santa.<br /><br />The albergue here is very nice and smells of old wood and smoke, I love it. Its a donativo, which means you pay as much as you want. In fact, the use of this computer is free! I love the more religious albergues, it´s such a more communal and nurturing environment for lone pilgrims like myself.<br /><br />The next 4 days look to be much easier. Dropping the average daily walk to about 20km, should have enough energy to go for an afternoon jog, or some sightseeing in leon. Me an old man today who was trying to impress me with his km per day... he is missing the point. The point of the camino is to enjoy the process, not make it some crazy race. <br /><br />Today´s last 8km was fantastic. A cloud followed me for about 2 hours, sheilding the sun and cooling me off. An easy flat path with a little jack johnson at the end goes a long way. <br /><br />Christina and I were talking about anxiety, and how sometimes you don´t know what to do with yourself in spare time and get anxious about a small decision. I think this is especially common for young people who don´t have the self confidence yet to make decisions and follow a set path. The camino is a great place to practice this, because it makes you realize a) the decision isn´t the end of the world, its all a matter of time, and b) sometimes you´ve gotta just go with the flow and wait to see what inspiration comes. After talking with kate today, I was so sure that I wanted to continue despite it being so late. I am very glad to have done so.<br /><br />Looking forward to tomorrows walk and a late morning cappuccino. Hopefully there are no big snorers in my room tonight, last night was pretty bad. You would be amazed at how loud some people are, its incredible. I will upload a recording if there are any more champion snorers in the future.<br /><br />After Leon in two days, I have a feeling things are going to speed up a bit. Galicia will fly by and suddenly we´ll be on santiago´s door step. Hoping to rent a bike over there and check out the portugal border. Time will tell!<br /><br />Missing you guys back at home. Much luv,<br />rob
