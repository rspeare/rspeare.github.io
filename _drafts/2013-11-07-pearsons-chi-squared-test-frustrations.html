<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">So this may sound like mathematical gobbledy gook to some readers, but I have to vent a little.<br /><br />Why on earth is there no documentation about the normalized variance of the Chi-squared distribution? The chi-squared statistic is defined as the sum:<br /><br />Chi^2 = Sum( Observed-Expected )^2 /(Expected)<br /><br />Which means that Chi^2 is a random variable composed of the sum of squares of other random variables. This often calls for a Gamma distribution, which is closed under convolutions and adequately describes such sums. Problem is, the denominator in this equation is unclear. Had we divided by the theoretical variance -- not the estimator -- we would have normalized each and every normal distribution to a variance of unity, and then, voila! you'd have the Chi-Squared distribution. But WE'RE not dividing by the variance, and therefore you can't assume that each squared random variable has unity variance. Ugh. I'm having trouble finding the answer to this. And it bothers me to think how many people use the Pearson's Chi-Squared test, not completely understanding how it's derived.<br /><br /></div>
