Oh yeah! Now sitting in bed between two clean sheets (first time out of the sleeping bag in 4 weeks). Benny is passed out on the bottom bunk. Barca and Madrid tied last night bit it was a great game. Went for a run this morning and ran with a Spanish duahlete. Found he track and a nice circuit for ge mornings. <br /><br />Today i am off to check out the bike situation, and if all works out well I'll b bikin to the ocean. Or, chillin here, running, and listening to all the audiobooks I just downloaded!<br /><br />Awww yeah
