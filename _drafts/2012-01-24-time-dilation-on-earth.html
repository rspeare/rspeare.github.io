Okay, so after reviewing some of these ideas a second time, its' starting to settle in. One of the coolest consequences of General Relativity is that time passes at different rates in Gravitational fields. For instance, a clock on the sun will tick at a different rate than a clock on earth, (or even a clock in space). <div><br /></div><div>The key to proving this involves something called the Newtonian approximation of the Geodesic equation, which basically means in human language that:</div><div>1) You (the person with the clock) are not moving very quickly. Your speed v, is much much less than the speed of light... ;<div>2) You are in a static gravitational field, meaning that the 'gravity' you feel does not change with time. Obviously this is true on most planets!</div><div>3) The gravitationally field is weak. Weak in the sense that you are nowhere close to the gravitational field of a blackhole. (You're local space-time is almost flat)</div><div><br /></div><div>Okay, so with these 3 assumptions you can get an equation for the time interval observed by a person in a gravitational potential:</div><div>T = (√1-2GM/r)t</div><div>Where T is the time observed by YOU in the gravitational field, and t is the time observed by someone in the complete absence of a gravitational field. This ratio T/t:</div><div>T/t = (√1-2GM/r)</div><div>T/t is just a little bit less than 1, since we are taking the square root of a number just a teeny bit less than 1 such as T/t=√(.9999999). For a black hole the ratio T/t is 0 and you're in big big trouble.</div><div><br /></div><div>But if you take a look at this now given some value less than 1:</div><div>T/t = .99999999</div><div>The time t, observed by someone in space is just a little bit more than the time T, observed by you in the gravitational field. AKA time runs faster in a gravitational field. </div><div><br /></div><div>In fact, satellites use this since a satellite's clock will run a bit slower than a clock on earth! In fact, a satellite 'loses' 1/2 of a billionth of second or .0000000005 seconds, every second. Signals travel from satellites at the speed of light (3x10^8 meters/sec). So, if you own a GPS watch that communicates with a satellite, but doesn't account for Einstein, then it will expect the satellite to be running on the same exact 'time'. Therefore, your GPS watch will expect signals from the satellite .0000000005secondes too early! This translates to you being displayed .15meters incorrectly in any given direction.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is incredibly important for military targeting of missiles and possibly even something completely amicable like google maps!</div><div><br /></div><div>Pretty crazy right? There's this joke in Hartle's intro to General Relativity, which states that theorists who work in the upstairs floor of the physics building are in a weaker gravitational field than those on the ground floor; therefore, their 'clocks' run slower and they live longer!</div><div><br /></div><div>woof,</div><div>Rob</div>&lt;&gt;</div>
