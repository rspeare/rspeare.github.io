I realize after reading "Letting Go" and getting deeper into the concerns of a marriage-contemplating 26 year old, how dangerously dramatic and inflated relationships can be at this age. At 24-26, men are at their intellectual "peak" for lack of a better word, the brain is more capable of absorbing and digesting than any other point in life. Granted, background information and training plays a part, but this is the most auspicious time for learning, broadening, and creation. At the same time, this is also the season for intense romantic interaction and the most violent time of intimate friendship formations -- and destructions. &nbsp;Although, I shouldn't use the verb to destroy, as if to insinuate some acute, distinct act of extirpation that clears correspondence; more like a slow enervation, etiolation. This is a dissatisfying process, but a necessary one -- since sustained friendships typically peak in the mid to late twenties.<br /><br />In the effort to attract, we -- and by that I mean I, let's be blunt about it -- overestimate our abilities and the magnitude of our life narrative, painting an intimidating, tantalizingly abstruse portrait of ourselves: emotions within emotions, folds within folds, motives within motives -- a convoluted, highfalutin mess. This irresistible construction, this fabricated semblance of ourselves, has immanent truths but also contains dangerous confabulations. True, time lends perspective and turns memories into elegant 'memwaahrs', like some fine interpersonal alembic -- a Shiraz; to be applied in the case of necessary understanding, context and emotional lubrication. After all, we are increasingly guarded and intransigent with age. Speciously good listeners, we slowly transform into islands as the years go by : superficially accepting, but cynical and complacent at core. Given this stolid nature of any serious relationship after age 15, we try to disarm each other, particularly in earnest, romantic discourse, with tales of the past. We all esteemed our existence at one point to be the crux and fulcrum of the universe -- why shouldn't we use this compelling story to charm and disarm others? The problem arises when both parties clamor for attention and begin grandiloquent self-description. Combined with weighty, magnanimous nods and bleary eye contact -- be it through drink or lack of sleep -- this solpsistic reflection only holds humbling despair for both parties. We are, after all, no different than the rest. No friendship bounds novel grounds, no love traverses the unseen or the unforeseen -- we are a paltry drop in the eternal human ocean.<br /><br />The continued indulgence of such conversations, of life-story exchange, of mutual auto-description, and, in the worst cases prescient self-eulogy for the severely depressed ideators, results in a hurtful thud back on earth; where the simpletons and brutes growl at each other for pecuniary emolument and cloying, unctuous remuneration. For the severely self-centered, it is not enough to be well liked, we must be adored; for, our estimation of ourselves is entirely out of proportion with the world's, until we find someone who loves us. Earnest &amp; incisive discourse can lead to the most insidious miscalculation of our lives; for who are we speaking to, listening to, waiting for when we meet in quiet cafes and hotel bars, moonlit walks and afternoon jogs; the sharing, by ulterior definition involves selfishness. Who doesn't revel in the attentive company of another? allowing them to aggrandize our worth with&nbsp;portentous&nbsp;smiles and saccharine platitudinizing.<br /><br />No, the best human exchange, the most reliable relief from despair, stripped of cynicism and myopic self-sympathy, is humor. Play.<br /><br />We are a species of luxury, no matter how you shake the genetic can. Or, correction, I am a member of the worst type of this species; there are those for whom survival is a daily concern, and awful tribulations haunt their every thought and dream. For such people, suffering is reality, and one is more licensed to self-describe than coddled wonks like myself; but, a point must be made, despite this ontological, circumstantial discrepancy between human beings : despair, like gas, fills the space provided.<br /><br />Those of us with the most cursory inconveniences, the most dainty of metaphysical scrapes and excoriations, we contemplate death too. Yes, those under veritable duress are more licensed to unload and convolute their story, but in some instances, suffering brings peace because there is an answer to the word <i>why</i>, when one looks into the mirror, the pillow, or the sky and feels visceral disappointment. Meaning: it's difficult to grasp without the prospect of creation, enjoyment or challenge in our future (V Frankl). What is one to think if he is drowning in a tepid bath of contentment and lassitude, some permutation of the brackish -- at later times alcoholic -- aristocratic pool which F. Scott Fitzgerald tried to describe?<br /><br />'You are a waste of space.' would be the first thought that comes to mind in the presence of such blissful euphoria. Where is the angst, the challenge, the growth that comes in the package of human life? Everyone consciously, or unconsciously, seeks the answer to this question. We create trials &amp; tribulations for ourselves through social drama, gossip, or slipshod material indulgence. Addiction. We are designed for pain, and without the required quota, go in search of easily acquired hurt. The most propitious occasion for which, in this new century of datasheets and digital titillations, lies in the world of boredom, incessant facebook scrolling, and a deadly deep comparison between ourselves and others -- always at a distance, never up close. We allow ourselves to pity and perdure beneath an onslaught of electronic ennui. <br /><br />This laziness is despicable.&nbsp;For those who hide behind twitter and FB updates, that illustrious coeval approbation comes through meretricious means. Be it through iChat, skype, gChat or drugs, pathos' effect is the same -- disillusionment and compounded isolation.<br /><br />It is only through focused, energetic play, sardonic humor, and objective analysis of the ridiculous world around us that we can begin to lift the bell jar. We should be kind enough to let each other know that life ain't&nbsp;<i>that</i>&nbsp;hard. After all, we're all in it together. We're all jumping through these lonesome hoops at a fundamental level. No other human presence has a chance to enter your mental space and befuddle or interpret your thoughts -- its just you : so offer a kind word, a smirk, a snide remark or a raffish wink; let us revel in our independence of each other and celebrate what we truly are -- mutual observers.<br /><br />This may sound self-defeating, as if one cannot exert his will on the world or engage another mind through honest means; but that is not the case. One can exert is will upon the world through serious, sedulous effort in the Physical realm; but when it comes to the chaotic human arena, where laws are ill-defined and&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;erratic, only the mal-adjusted try to exert their influence through straightforward, brute force will power. "Just be yourself", the terrible aphorism, eructated by mothers worldwide: to their sons in the face of romantic, adolescent rejection; to their daughters when looking upon the daunting transitional landscapes of high school, college and the adult dating world. Unfortunately this is sound advice. By being reticent, patient, comfortable in your own skin, you will be able to accomplish more in 10min than a cloying, amorphous, sentimentally protean sycophant gets to in 10 years.&nbsp;Like Robert Louis Stevenson, the archetypal dweeb-turned-truant said: transcendent independence is attractive to other sole beings, and humour to boot is a salubrious panacea for your life and many others; Don't overestimate yourself; Don't over-pontificate yourself and do not be a flamboyant bleeding heart. Be silly, and enjoy this sadistic design just like countless others before you; and, after you.
