A little flood forest pic,  a quick shot of san pedro from the water. And a nice shot of the lake.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_bgicGgqp2tI/TNcC1t28IZI/AAAAAAAAALI/Cns59sSPqtc/s1600/PB020340.JPG"><img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_bgicGgqp2tI/TNcC1t28IZI/AAAAAAAAALI/Cns59sSPqtc/s320/PB020340.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5536897388741665170" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_bgicGgqp2tI/TNcByLFL6dI/AAAAAAAAAKk/Dm6QT2qaAVo/s1600/PB010329.JPG"><img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_bgicGgqp2tI/TNcByLFL6dI/AAAAAAAAAKk/Dm6QT2qaAVo/s320/PB010329.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5536896228354943442" border="0" /></a>Sweet clouds up on top of San Pedro right!<br />Ok, had a tough couple of days after a slip in the lake and maybe some  bad street cookies. But, I am on the way to recovery now (don´t fret  yours<img src="file:///F:/DCIM/100OLYMP/PB010319.JPG" alt="" />elves ma  and pa, it was simply 2 days of sitting in bed watching the incredible  hulk in spanish subtitles).  To celebrate, it´s picture time! Couple  pictures from up on top of san pedro. The cloud formations were  beautiful up there. To the bottom left are the three spanish travellers.  The girl with the hip sunglasses was the angel who gave me 3 pills of  ibuprofren to get back down the mountain :). And of course finally a  massive dead snake that thomas and I found while walking back down the  mountain road to town. Below are the 3 young spaniards we met. Ma, they all had lisps given there c´s, and z´s.<br /><br />And now just because there is nothing much else to do, i will allow myself to rant a little about recent experiences. San Pedro and San marcos are two pretty big gringo magnets in Guatemala. Mostly because of the sights and calm atmosphere. However: there is a TON of drug abuse here. Mostly pot and alcohol, but my goodness i have never seen so many hippies. Some people get very annoyed with these hippies because all they want to do is smoke and talk about the planets or something. But, i have to say i thoroughly enjoy their company. It´s a nice experience to meet people so far out of my own experience-comfort zone. Of course swarthmore has its own breed of hippy, these guys have taken it up a notch. Dreadlock, bandanas, no showers, selling hemp as and health food as a main source of income. This is a lifestyle that fascinates me. I think it takes a  lot of courage to give up developed society and accept a more aceitic life, but maybe they just want to smoke all day... and being high can change your perception of what´s comfortable :). Nonetheless, i have yet to meet a mean pothead, while i have met plenty of mean drunks.<br /><br />Been talking recently with my friend juan (an owner of a clothing store here) and his plans to illegally enter the united states with the help of his brother. There are some people who swim across rivers, oceans, even walk for several days without food or water, just to arrive in the united states for the opportunities that we have. The opportunity to earn money, create a comfortable and safe life for our families is such a gift that was always difficult to realize growing up in  such an idyllic suburb-highly safe and educated town. There are farms, houses, stores that are robbed and looted here every day. And this is one of the most tranquil towns in all of guatemala. And of course what is the law enforcement like? Almost nothing. Sometimes the townspeople take matters into their own hands and make people ´"dissapear". Yikes. The only law enforcement around here recently has been to control the drug problem affecting the youth. There have been 10 year old and such using pot and being accustomed to drug abuse at a  very young age. If there´s anything that will enact a local government, it is a threatened youth. This is actually a pretty cool common trait that i´ve noticed between Guatemala and the US. We are both very protective of our children (in most cases). The government pouts a lot of effort into developing the next citizens7/leaders of the country. (of course at times, this is taken too far in very developed countries that have a high focus on education and competition, leading to very unhappy or stressed children desperately searching for some niche of success in order to get ahead. Be it math, science, biology, football, track, squash, checkers, chess, crew, or some other strange activity, i have found that all american children desperately search for a specialty that sets them apart from the group. I am sure it is the exact same in countries such as china and japan, given their dispotion to achievement and a high level of discipline (may sound a bit racist but is ultimately a compliment).<br /><br />Really what i am trying to get at here is what is better? A highly successful country where opportunities are lain at the feet of the youth in so many different areas, or a country where there are limited opportunities of academic and financial success and therefore more emphasis on other things such as simply surviving, living, and maintaining family structure (a latin american sentiment)? I believe the answer is somewhere in the middle. Yes, such a frustrating answer is moderation...<br /><br />As stray dogs, happy old tourists, and hipster younguns, took tooks, and indigenous t·zutujil speaking people walk in front of this internet cafe, i realize how many different "metas" exist in this world all at the same time. Everyone is chasing their own carrot, their own passion. And for those without passion or family, there is always drugs, wandering, and worldly pleasures.<br /><br />Desafortunamente en este momento mi meta es para conseguir una meta, pero lo que es sostenible y inolvidable. Hay personas aca quienes estan buscando por algo, o a veces estan corriendo afuera de sus problemas, yo hago lo mismo en un sentido, yo busco sabiduria, perspectiva, inspiracion. Con cada persona que conozco, yo aprendo mas to la naturaleza humana y que lo inspira.<br /><br />Oh my goodness really hot hippy girl just walked by, might have to go...<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_bgicGgqp2tI/TNcBxzenJkI/AAAAAAAAAKc/rO4xOv69kic/s1600/PB010320.JPG"><img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_bgicGgqp2tI/TNcBxzenJkI/AAAAAAAAAKc/rO4xOv69kic/s320/PB010320.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5536896222019135042" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_bgicGgqp2tI/TNcAVu4JKjI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/7XEr0ObkSjI/s1600/PB010333.JPG"><img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_bgicGgqp2tI/TNcAVu4JKjI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/7XEr0ObkSjI/s320/PB010333.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5536894640236079666" border="0" /></a>
