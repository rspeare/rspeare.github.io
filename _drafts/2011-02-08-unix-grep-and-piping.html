Piping, filtering and especially Grep are here to help. When you type text into the command line and press enter, you are using your operating system's standard input, which is a really nice way to interact with the computer. What is placed back on the screen is standard output, also heavily tied to your operating system. Now you can actually direct this output into files, filters and even programs using some pretty cool operators.</p> <p class="p2"><br /></p> <p class="p1">> redirect operator</p> <p class="p1">rob$ ls > file.txt (this places the output of ls into a text document named file)</p> <p class="p1">However, if the file already existed then you are in deep trouble, because all of its previous contents are erased. To combat this, you can use the append operator</p> <p class="p1">>> append operator</p> <p class="p1">rob$ ls >> file.txt (This appends the output of ls into a text document named file)</p> <p class="p1">| Piping operator</p> <p class="p1">rob$ ls | sort (this sorts and then prints ls output alphabetically using the filer sort!)</p> <p class="p2"><br /></p> <p class="p1">Now more on piping so that we can use some filters! Some common filters in UNIX are:</p> <p class="p1">sort (sorts alphabetically)</p> <p class="p1">grep (searches for given pattern)</p> <p class="p1">wc (counts the words lines and characters)</p> <p class="p2"><br /></p> <p class="p1">examples</p> <p class="p1">rob$ ls | sort (sorts ls output alphabetically)</p> <p class="p1">rob$ ls | grep .txt (lists all files with .txt extension in current directory)</p> <p class="p1">rob$ ls | grep .txt | sort (lists all .txt files alphabetically!)</p> <p class="p1">rob$ ls | wc (lists the lines words and characters in ls output... Or the number of files!)</p> <p class="p1">rob$ ls | grep .txt | wc (lists the number .txt files in the current directory)</p> <p class="p2"><br /></p> <p class="p1">As you can see, you can pipe standard output through multiple filters, allowing you to get some very specific stuff.</p> <p class="p2"><br /></p> <p class="p1">Now finally, if you want to filter through the actual contents of a file, use the the commands "more" or "cat". These commands put the contents of a file onto the terminal screen. But be careful with these because and redirection because you can accidentally overwrite some important files.</p> <p class="p2"><br /></p> <p class="p1">Examples</p> <p class="p1">rob$ more mydocument.txt | grep Author</p> <p class="p1">This would go inside the mydocument.txt file and output the line which contains "Author"</p> <p class="p2"><br /></p> <p class="p2"><br /></p>
