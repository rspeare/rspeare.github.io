<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Those sullen saggy jaws grind side to side, up and down, forwards and backwards in a circular motion of distracted mastication. There are three sets of lips, teeth and tongue, all engaging in the same practice of chomping, chewing, and smacking. I cannot tear my eyes away from this Cafe table across the room. Physics practice problems no longer hold my attention. Who are these people and why aren't they speaking to each other? Why do they look so exhausted and impatient? Was there an argument? An insult? Some terrible falling out? Why does the middle masticator throw looks askance about the room, directly down the bridge of her nose, as she sips poignantly, primly, pathetically from her coffee cup? This group is so strange, so interesting, so off the beaten path of my people-watching dossier that I feel compelled to document their appearance and demeanor; hopefully avoiding personality extrapolation and pretentious generalization, an easy indulgence from my high horse over on the far corner of this coffee shop.<br /><br />The middle-masticator is an elegantly clad, corpulent woman. She has a greasy mat of short, seemingly chopped hair and a pallid neck wrapped in a golden-gossamer-shawl. Her eyes are glazed -- borderline bleary -- fixated on some floor tile to her 2 o' clock. Her furrowed brow is immobile and full of pock marks and areolas. Slightly raised eyebrows communicate a sustained, refined amusement at whatever speck of dust she is contemplating on the floor. Her haircut, I must say, is aggressively short. It is the edgy style that I have seen women use to stand out or to intimidate their male (and female) antagonists. Based upon the tired scowl, the listless drumming of dainty fingers upon her breast bone, and the intermittent, scathing looks round' the room, I'm guessing pretentious intimidation is the grooming-objective.<br /><br />What does a short, greasy, unkempt haircut connote in an older, obviously affluent woman? Her husband sits to her left, with an outstretched rooster neck, baggy eyelids, and the same dejected motion of pastry-chewing. He looks as if he hasn't slept in weeks and the deep creases and cracks along his cheeks communicate great age or great accumulated stress. He picks up his coffee and places it to his lips in slow motion: to fill up conversational&nbsp;vacuum&nbsp;(of which there seems to be a surfeit) or to evade predatory agression by his dominating wifey' -- I can't tell from my high-horse. A female friend sits next to my main subject of ogling (the middle-masticator); she faces the opposite wall but I can see a swollen bag of clothes and some expensive, frilly lace flowing from the top of a cardboard box. They must have been out shopping for shoes, or dresses, or some other fancy thing that deserves post-purchase adornment. In the context of a shopping trip, the dejected demeanor of the husband, the victoriously prim countenance of the wife, the conflict-avoiding&nbsp;contentment of the female friend, begins to make sense. That poor B----- sitting in the chair next to that awfully-slowly-chewing-woman; he must be fighting tooth and nail for his balls &amp; male dignity at this point. Unless, of course, I have been entirely wrong in my perception of the situation and he is simply her retarded brother -- dreaming and drinking away brutish thoughts.<br /><br />If the final sentence sounded harsh, let me make it clear: this party of three could not be any more depressing. It makes me sad to see these three people despair in each other's company. Each member seems impatient for the end, seems to be suffering through every minute under the false guise of gustatory formality. There is no attempt for conversation, no inkling of interaction -- there is no life at that coffee table, just death. Oh sure, the reader can salvage this party by imagining a source for their distraction: maybe they're reading books, magazines, newspapers; maybe they're perusing Facebook, or furiously tapping out text messages, writing important e-mails, etc. etc. -- all the activities that provide sanctuary from the company of human beings. No, reader, I'm afraid not. This party of three has been sitting and staring off into space for the past two hours. Would they be so impatient for the end, so uncomfortably grim, if the only other option was death? It seems so. What an awful curse, to grow forlorn and miserable in the presence of your family -- which is certainly what this group is, otherwise I don't know how a sane person could classify them as 'friends'.<br /><br />To describe this despotic, middle-aged, more than buxom female (the middle masticator), I will try to go through some specifics : she is wearing thick black leggings, most likely cotton, which swell and stretch across her rotund legs. Thick ankles, which compress alarmingly quickly into two tiny golden slippers, which in retaliation reject a giant bulge of foot-mass and send it arching and oozing over the shoe-tongue. Her hands are small in comparison with blubber-filled forearms. Those small paws tap impatiently on her chest -- although I don't know what she is so anxious about, perhaps the exit from this cafe and the next shopping mall binge -- alternatively stroking her neck, intimately caressing her desperately feminine jowls. 'Caressing those skin bags won't make em' any more supple honey!' cries out my imaginary Phil Roth in the room.<br /><br />What is it about this woman's manner the peeves me so much? Does she really deserve such awful description? No. But what instigated this post was her perceptible emotional terrorism. When faced with input from her coffee table mates, our subject would lift her chin, raise her eyebrows -- wrinkling that forehead -- and squint til' her eyelids were imperceptibly close; she would begin to nod ominously, and jut out her bottom lip in a pompous attitudinizing frown, the equivalent of which I have never seen. Her sententious demeanor was palpable, even from fifty feet away, and I pity the man who must manage her mood and gratify her consumerist urges with his credit card. Of course, she could be the working woman of the family, but solely based on her bodily arrogance, her perceptible sense of entitlement, I would guess she is past her working days.<br /><br />As they left the Cafe, I watched closely for any signs of life in the group. They exited slowly, deliberately, just as they had sipped their coffee in silence for hours. As they turned the corner and began ambulating down the street, I saw a slight hitch in each of their strides -- each 'Cafe Cow' had a limp. Whether it be from stiffness and old age, or some earlier brawl where they kicked and mauled each other in the shins, falling into sullen silence afterwards, I hope this party of three heals, reconciles, and finds a more optimistic gait, a more cheerful countenance, together.&nbsp;</div>
