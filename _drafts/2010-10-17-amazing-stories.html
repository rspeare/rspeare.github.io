So just spent the rainy afternoon listening to some of Laurel´s and thomas´s life stories. They were so incredible I felt that I had to summarize a bit on the blog.<div><br /></div><div>So Laurel has spent the last 4 or 5 summer living in banff, a huge vacation resort area in canada. In the mornings, from 6am to about 12pm, she worked as a waitress, earning tips and what not, while living in employee housing. At 1 o clock, she would go out with her friends on 8 or 9 hour hikes up these incredible mountains. The pictures are absolutely breathtaking. During the weekends she would go ice climbing or on 3 or 4 day hikes across ice fields and up glaciers to the top of incredibly high mountains. One story she told me that was particularly interesting was when they had to hike 3 days to reach a certain back country mountain over ice fields. On the way back, there was some sort of problem and so many people began to lose body heat and get symptoms of hypothermia. Luckily, there is this company called the canada shield which is a gigantic co op that sells camping equipment without the normal corporate taxes. All the products are uniform and  exchangeable, so her entire group meshed all their sleeping bags into one giant sleeping bag and huddled up together to gain body heat. How crazy is that!!!! </div><div><br /></div><div>And thomas, good god. While working as in a ski shop in utah and while working in yellowstone, typically went out for trail runs, rock climbs, bouldering and free traditional climbing. Now by trail running, i don´t mean  the normal 6 mile loop that I am used to. Thomas used to go for 30 mile, 6 hour epics across and up, and over mountains. One story that was particularly special was a 24 hour push he did in utah. Where he ran 20 miles from a trail entrance to reach a mountain range, proceeded to scale this range and reached each of the 7 peaks, then descended the mountain back to the car for 23 hours of pure running and hiking. He and his friend passed out in his truck in their sleeping bags and woke up about 15 hours later.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now what is this typical goodie two shoes white boy supposed to say in response to that? </div>
