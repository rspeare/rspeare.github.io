Whew! Holy crap. So the first stage was very physical. 17 miles with 1400 meters of climbing and then 600m of steep descent. The feet and the knees hurt, but let me tell you! That lentil soup with some fish was friggin awesome today!<div><br /></div><div>So started out this morning at 7:30am, couldnÂ´t sleep last night because I honestly was very nervous. </div>
