Thoughts on the road<br /><br />So today, I'm going to take down some notes while I walk on the iPhone and then cut and paste later on the blog. <br /><br />First of all, it is very cold. My fingers are struggling to hit these keys. It's about 4 celcius.<br /><br />Walking along a river that runs through Burgos. As I watch the water walk along with me, I think that I am very much like the water, moving slowly but consistently to cross countries mountains etc.<br /><br />Walking by an outdoor track right now... I so badly want to do burn some mondo rubber!<br /><br />Walked five hours yesterday to Miley Cyrus. Tried Tchaikovsky for a bit... But I'm bAck at it again :) <br /><br />Just got to hontanas with Toby, Maria, jim, and Julia. Sitting outside with an ice cream sandwich and a big tub o water. This is a beautiful town, but the people are not very nice. The albergue owners are outside complaining about us pilgrims. They're saying that the outsiders are taking buses instead of walking the camino in a very condescending way. What they don't realize is that many pilgrims are in the previous town, since this is an awkward distance at 30km from Burgos. They also must not realize or care that I understand what they're saying. Such is life at work though sometimes, people jus complain about the situation they're given to pass the time. I personally don't appreciate Spanish pilgrims and albergue owners speaking badly of extranjeros.<br /><br />Amazing shower today, great pressure and temperature! Might have taken some liberties with time spent in the ducha.<br /><br />...<br />Just woke a petty terrible dream. I fell off a sinking boat and drowned. I think I handled it well though, gosh o hate warm temperatures while sleeping, they make you have nightmares<br /><br />...walked through a really isolated part of the mesera today. So tired. These afternoons without anything to do caN be quite difficult when you are exhausted. A good lesson in patience. The funny thing about the camino is that after walking for 5 or 6 hours you just want to sit still, but at the same time you want to be entertained. Your body wants to rest while the mind wants to wander, it's a tough  combination.
