So after a good bit of sugar, and this being the first time I can use the hostel computer. Let{s upload some factoids about some interesting stuff!<br /><br />WikiLeaks<br /><br />Started by an Australian internet activist. This white haired man has gone from earning awards of free press from european organizations to getting into some serious legal trouble with the united states and possibly some of the european union. He is a physics, math, and computer science wiz and founded the wikileaks website along with others in 2006. Now despite all the articles and cables that wikileaks has gained access to and getting into complicated opinions. Let{s review just how smart these guys really are.<br /><br />First of all, the key to sustaining a website is having a supporting server. For instance, if you would like to post up your own website using HTML code, then you will actually have to pay a public server to support your website. This is so that internet surfers will get an answer when the cpu{s send out a search request onto the internet. Basically this server has to be on all the time and can never be turned off. Also, the server has to have a certain amount of processing power to support many visitors to the site. (This is what it means when a server is down, basically the processing units of the server cannot withstand all the requests being made)<br /><br />So, if this organization wants to put up some high quality not so wanted information where will they put it? With a highly liberal and private swiss company of course!!<br />The following is a quote from wikipedia... WikiLeaks is hosted by PRQ, a Sweden-based company providing “highly secure, no-questions-asked hosting services.” PRQ is said to have “almost no information about its clientele and maintains few if any of its own logs.” The servers are spread around the world with the central server located in Sweden.[54]<br /><br />Wow, so thats some servers that are hard to get at physically. But of course, this didn{t stop cybernet attackers trying to shut down the site. Because of so many attacks, wikileaks moved its internet support to Amazon servers, which amazon then rejected (probably because of sheer traffic and annoyance). I think they are currently supported by a french company named OVH. Good luck to them, since a previous domain registrant, basically a guy who helped support the server, had his house broken into by the german army and searched. YIKES!<br /><br />To get to the audience in China and past the great big firewall of censorship, wikileaks actually creates new cover adresses to get past the big Red china{s embargo on the word wikileaks. Any url containing the word wikileaks cannot be accessed behind the chinese firewall, however they didnt count out the word sunshinepress, or suavepress! Very very clever people, and motivated I might add.<br /><br />So what is all this hullaballo called? Bulletproof hosting. Sweet phrase right?<br /><br />CMOS<br /><br />Oh, and thank god I finally found how a CMOS transistor works! Basically this thing is how we store all of our information today so listen up! CMOS stands for complimentary metal oxide semiconductor. These things became really popular in the 80s when computing power was really starting to take off because of two reasons... power consumption and noise resistance. Oh, and they are really friggin small (hundreds of millions of these cmos units can fit on a gram cracker sized chip). <br /><br />So how does CMOS transistor work? Well it uses the advantages of silicon to its fullest. When you n dope or p dope a piece of silicon, you make that piece of silicon carry extra electrons, or lose them. Therefore making these regions slightly charged. Now an nMOS and pMOS transistor are just pieces of silicon that have been n n doped or p doped... making the regions negatively charged or positively charged. Now in between two doped regions, one can place a silicon dioxide plate, therefore separating the two charged-doped areas and stopping current from flowing between them. The normal undoped silicon in between two doped areas is just like a cork between to pipes. But here comes the ingenious part, when one puts a little bit of charge in the middle of these two doped areas, on the silicon dioxide plate it attracts charge out of the "normal" silicon barrier and allows charge to flow between the two doped regions.<br /><br />So, what does this mean? It means that when you apply a negative charge to the silicon dioxide plate, or whats called the gate, you allow current to flow and recieve a message on the other end of the line. NOw this can be designed any way you like. Such as input high voltage recieve low voltage, or input low recieve low. input 0 get 1, input 1 get 0 and so on and so on. <br /><br />So with this simple little tool, you have all you need to create logical functions such AND OR NOT XOR that operate on digital binary variables like NO and YES. And this, is how your computer multiplies, writes, reads, and downloads "the hills" for your viewing pleasure.<br /><br />Now why is CMOS so popular? because it requires practically no energy to maintain in working condition. The doped silicon will always be charged whether it is recieving charge or not, and therefore it create what{s called STATIC logical gates, which are gates that don{t need and power. aka, your computer will work just fine when you turn it back on, the cpu or cerebrum won{t change. <br /><br />Telephones and multiplexers<br /><br />Did you guys know that every phone call you have made has been joined by possibly 24 other parties on the same telephone line? This is due to a logical unit called a multiplexer. <br /><br />Every conversation that you{ve ever had through a telephone had an inherent frequency, or rate of bits that were arriving and being processed into sound. The higher the frequency, the better the quality of your voice. However, how on earth can a phone wire take in your voice and spit out your girlfriends at the same time? Well the multiplexer is a device that has an operating frequency at least twice that of your phone. It fragments your voice thousands of times per second and then sends it to your partner... however, during that the time that it wasn{t recording your voice, it was recording someone elses (since there certaintly are a lot of opportunities to record some bits during each second). So during that time or space between your voice fragments being sent away, you were recieving fragments from the other side. In fact there are what{s called T1 telephone lines that can support up to 24 conversations! That means that your voice could be traveling up there with 48 people! Whoa. <br /><br />Now for some quantum mechanics spirituality. Now this is why talking in person is worth so much. Because instead of recieving digital, for sure information at about 3.4 kHz (3000 bits a second), you are recieving millions of qubits per second. And, each of these qubits has an unsure quantum state, it is not simply a zero or a one but a whole spectrum of properties, qubits are misterious and beautiful with bits are exact but boring. <br /><br />So next time youre talking to a good friend in person, you can honestly tell them that it is more than 1,000 times better (at least in sound quality)to hear their voice in person.
