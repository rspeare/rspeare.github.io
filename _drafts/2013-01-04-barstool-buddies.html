A man is dipping his fingers into a thin film of tabletop beer and condensation. He slides his coaster back and forth, squeezing and palpating his mug in those thick knobby hands: deeply creased, swollen, arthritic knuckles and yellow fingernails -- a smoker; mottled areolas and eschars climbing up his forearms into a thick green army jacket. Furrowed white eyebrows. Rheumy and bloodshot blue eyes. Droopy fold of skin for eye creases, gravity's sedulous effect on crow's feet. A mountainous nose and etiolated lips, he stares into the bartop, stealing intermittent glances skyward -- to check the score.<br /><br />She rocks on her heels, looks beyond my shoulder into the crowd. I look up at the football game. Another flat joke. Another reflective pause. Her awkward asperity I don't quite understand. I turn to the bar with my codger cohort -- the one in the army jacket -- she can take care of herself. Good riddance.<br /><br />The inveterate -- possibly veteran -- barstool gaffer and I are attended by a cute woman in a turquoise tank top and tight black leggings: I'm more distracted than he is. An interesting bouncer leans over and tries to steal her attention; he's wearing a white bandana, a silver-linked chain, a black leather jacket, and big, thick, baggy jeans. Complete with a greasy ponytail, he's a biker David Foster Wallace. My senescent seat-mate waits for his next drink, patiently.<br /><br />Oasis blares over the conversational din and after a few beers Im drowning in drunken complacency. A bond is formed between fed up men in loud bars. Who or what is <i>he</i>&nbsp;saying 'good riddance' to? in this stuffy bar, full of bundled men and women round' wooden tabletops. Given the hipster beanies and V-necks, nascent beards and lambchops, striped scarves and quadric flannels, I wouldn't say this is his scene. He has age, true age -- not the puerile verisimilitude we wonks portray, striving ardently for wisdom and worldliness. Why spend time down here, downing diminutive drafts among us boisterous youth? I want to speak to him, but can't. His silent contemplation of that coaster makes it seem as if he is incapable of speech. I will imitate, for a while. Just like many others in this bar, take on an air of gravity and&nbsp;apocryphal&nbsp;experience.<br /><br />I will try be to as interesting and enigmatic as him; maybe then she'll talk to me.
