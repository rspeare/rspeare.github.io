Okay, so last night in xela. Sitting here under my sleeping bag and 3 woolen sheets. Wong who my sleeping pad on the floor of the my room. Located at 19th avenue quetzaltenango right by thencity cementary. Listenng to andrew bird and drawn deez... Startng to finally digest this entire trip. Went on what's a called a posada his evening ehch basically nvolves a Jesus manger replica through the city and then giving ansermon at the altars destination. Said my goodbyes again, this time wig more a few more hugs andnsme cards and poems hat I had written for good friends. <br /><br />Travelers are strange in that they are impermanent, and a school like casa xelaju sees students pass through every few days. So the question you ask yourself as you walk home or to the airport, back to people who are more permanent and weight bearing in your life - what have you learned? And then you may realize that one lesson is thenimpermanence of all relationships and the fact that your presence in a particular placenisnshort lived and therefore not very important. You may even feel very lane in between the traveling world, in limbo between andnabroas and domestic. But, in my experience, I sensed a feeling of loneliness tnight. Especially sncenmegan may not be coming down and I may have yet another week without a lot of man contact. On the other hand, I may have learned quite a bit about myself during this trip - I am not sure just yet, but it was a stent feeling of independence and pride that I felt walking through xela tonight. I have entered a completely different world and learned a language, sought out adventures some scary some not, and I have created a life that I can be proud of without the approval or guidance of anyone else ( except for financial help from mom and dad of course). I just may have learned something tonight and por lo menos, I felt something that will last some time tonight while carryin little baby Jesus on my shoulders with 3 other guatemalans. <br /><br />Extremely excited to return home. But of course I don't want this process to end. I would like to keep learning, keep challenging myself. even in thenloving and comforting company of my family. I love you Meg Kate mom dad. <br /><br />I hope that the temp doesn't drop below -10 degrees celcius like las night. But the pressure and weight of multiple blankets is like a warm embrace. Why else do children like to be tucked in? In he inspiration of that thought a few words from one of my favorite songs (10 bikes if you can guess it)<br /><br />I am just a little boy inside, who cries out for attention but I always try to hide, and I take anymore of this I wanna come apart, and dig myself a little place inside your perfect heart. Cause it's always raining in my head, forget all the hngs I should have said.<br />  <br />Patient and content in this wool cocoon of mine. Waiting for the next day.
