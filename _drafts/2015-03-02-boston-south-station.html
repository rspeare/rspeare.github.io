<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"><span data-mce-style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;" style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;">Sitting in Boston south station now, at the stubborn end of winter, and I can see why DFW almost killed himself here: the homeless are louder and more communal than in New York; more performative and domineering of public space, due to an absence of crowds. The desperation, the indifference of life, is apparent here, and I find myself thinking "how do you deal with such a place, if you're a little too sensitive, a little too ogling and observant?". I imagine -- or should I say reminisce, via fiction -- the Boston halfway house and the hilarious antics, the threatening volatility of each inmate; I imagine the hard work it took to watch and listen and reflect, to drill down to the humanity of each wayward 'character'. Maybe what saves us, temporarily, is discovering the humorous, the sentimental, the -- purportedly "snot warm" -- childish layer of things that DFW was so good at conceiving and perceiving.</span></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"><br /></div><div data-mce-style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;" style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;">Otherwise it's too scary. And I say this because I'm an ogling young man with holes in my shoes. A meager graduate student stipend and a silly attachment to not wasting money -- despite a continued exorbitance in food, which follows from a coddled, steak-dinner-infused childhood -- have kept me from buying winter boots, and now, as cold sidewalks and cold floors reverberate through my feet and flimsy rubber soles, making them stiffen and throb and curl, I feel an uncomfortable intimacy with the "inmates" of Boston south station. These scrofulous, strange, outspoken men aren't much different from that of a well-imagined -- or well-remembered -- halfway house, and my privileged fear of proximity, be it in fate or physical, isn't much different than any other "upstanding" citizen's. We all try to make our way in the world -- particularly in travel -- with as little inconvenience and distraction as possible. Some might say it's a waste of time to think about the homeless, or that it's morally mastubatory, but when your shoes look, and probably feel the same,&nbsp;thought creeps in.<br /><br /></div><div data-mce-style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;" style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;"></div><div data-mce-style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;" style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;"></div><div data-mce-style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;" style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;">&nbsp;I know myself well enough to say that this deterioration of footwear is just a lazily helpless, puerile habit of mine: of letting necessary things go, labeling them as "superficial" or "frivolous" in a backhanded effort to elevate -- and, congratulate -- myself philosophically. I have also been wearing these shoes down, grinding their soles into oblivion out of love. My frigid, tight plantar fascia are a side effect of thoughtless affection, and yet, they are also a thoughtful --&nbsp;deeply&nbsp;masochistic -- design to frighten myself into industriousness. But after today, I am scared enough. Tomorrow will bring new shoes, and one can only hope, warmer weather.</div><div data-mce-style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;" style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;"></div><div data-mce-style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;" style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;"><br /></div><div data-mce-style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;" style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px;"></div></div>
