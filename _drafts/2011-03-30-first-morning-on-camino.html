Well, its six o clock and the albergue is buzzing with pilgrims ready to start on the first and hardest day of the camino. St Jean to Roncevalles is 26 km long, with an altitude rise of 1500m. We are all well rested, but have no idea whats truly in store over the next 4-6 weeks.<div><br /></div><div>The crowd here is definitely of the older variety. Mostly 40ish age, well established citizens in their own country. One guy I have met is a 22 year old ex army from dublin. </div><div><br /></div><div>Bien camino!</div>
