<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Global Balance:<br />Irreducibility &amp; Aperiodicity: Our Transfer matrix has a single, unique eigenvalue of modulus one.<br /><br />\begin{eqnarray}<br />\lambda = 1<br />\end{eqnarray}<br /><br />If there is another eigenvalue -- possibly complex -- of modulus one, the markov chain does not converge to a steady state. This can be represented with a two block array, where a ball MUST move between two blocks. &nbsp;If we introduct a small probability<br /><br />"We must avoid recurring states"<br /><br />Take the eigenvector of the transfer matrix, subtract it from our current state, and take the absolute value. This will be the measure of our distance from equilibrium.<br /><br />The one half thumb rule: When the fraction of moves that are accepted reaches 1/2,&nbsp;</div>
