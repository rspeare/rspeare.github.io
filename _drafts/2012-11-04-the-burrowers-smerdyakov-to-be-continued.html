<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><a href="http://robspeare.com/2012/11/04/the-burrowers-smerdyakov/">New Blog Post (Click this Link if you don't like dark letters)</a><br /><br /><br /><div style="background-color: black; border: 0px; color: #bbbbbb; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20.016666412353516px; margin-bottom: 20px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">They had cleaned out the room sedulously, perfectly, with a diligence unequalled by any other 3 bachelors one can imagine. The glossy white tiles shined with a brilliance unequalled in any other pad you’d ever lay eyes upon. It was simply a calvinist triumph. A successful attempt to emulate the clean-shaven studliness of the studly three. Sam was the impeccable dresser, the avant-garde philosopher (formerly a student at Harvard, where he dropped out due to a recurring depression). Emanuel, the man’s man, had a calm demeanor and muscles the size of small animals strewn around his body; He, E., made women swoon with his bulging biceps and&nbsp;voluptuous-firm&nbsp;bum. Ibrahim was the best of all jokesters. He could game with the most fiery women and men over gin and tonic, rum, whisky, beer, vodka, schnapps, Jager — didn’t matter; he could engage in the most heated political debates without ever saying anything real. Ibrahim, I., was totally emotionally inaccessible to others and yet a tour de force in conversation.</div><div style="background-color: black; border: 0px; color: #bbbbbb; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20.016666412353516px; margin-bottom: 20px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 2.5em; vertical-align: baseline;">Sam was the calm vivisector of the three, subjecting his rivals — and himself — to terribly persistent questioning. He would tie himself into excruciating knots; hardly able to breathe beneath the pressure of his arguments and counter-arguments. His pursuit of esoteric fact was a selfish indulgence — or so he rationalized — and his consistent attempts to portray edification in the company of others was a manifestation of his own developmental self-consciousness. On the surface, this man, S., was a prim put together specimen — The perfect Cambridge Bachelor. Underneath he was a desperate, egotistical child. S. had a mind like steel, which cringed and curled into ugly spirals when put under overwhelming strain. There were certain directions of torque, certain specific-heats that rendered him mutable to terrible pain and loathing. Beside the heat of a woman, S. would go bend and darken, swaying towards that arbiter of feminine authority in his domain. This process of rendering S. pliable, gullible, amenable to influence took a great deal of work. He was no easy customer to friends or family in his emotional exchanges; S. left no room for interpretation in ninety-nine percent of his dialectics. Luckily, the presence of E. and I. kept S. within his sane limits; the dangerous precipice which he had been treading, contemplating, for years at Massachusets while studying Nietzche and Kierkegaard had slowly receded from his sight — with his two metaphysically-grounded nurses driving the ambulance. S., left to his own devices, was a fiercely disturbed member of the intelligentsia who could immolate and perish without the assuaging bubble of beer and ‘bros’. ‘Thank god for those two’, thought S. as he said his nightly pleadings.</div><div style="background-color: black; border: 0px; color: #bbbbbb; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20.016666412353516px; margin-bottom: 20px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 2.5em; vertical-align: baseline;">Emanuel was a different man altogether. He didn’t let the knocks of life keep him down for a great deal of time; he enjoyed the challenge of failure, and the jest of continually, uselessly, picking yourself up ‘by your bootstraps’ in the walks of life. E. could ham it up with the most jovial or solemn of crowds; the master of the anodyne comment, the artist of feigned empathy and interest, the greatest syncretic hand to interlocution you could possibly imagine. E. was the expert friend, the trained and patient listener, the passive perceiver. E. let experiences flow through him like the tepid August water of the Florida shore — pissing away his attempts at worldly influence like the paltry piddle he knew it was. E. was at peace, and the only thing that held him back from Nirvana was the presence of his two ‘bros’.</div><div style="background-color: black; border: 0px; color: #bbbbbb; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20.016666412353516px; margin-bottom: 20px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 2.5em; vertical-align: baseline;">The single vice in E., was that beneath all of his patient posing, seemingly genuine listening, (the type that communicates, ‘yes I’m really listening but not listening too too hard, so just lay it all out on the line, I care’), was a terribly uncontrollable sulking for the state of other people — particularly his friends and family. Even when E. was pretending not to listen, or pretending to be pretending to be listening — he still listened, vigilantly. E. assiduously detected and contemplated despair.</div><div style="background-color: black; border: 0px; color: #bbbbbb; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20.016666412353516px; margin-bottom: 20px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 2.5em; vertical-align: baseline;">E. recognized that many times during his life he was a loved, but not respected, sounding board. Given sufficient sententious brow beating by a pessimistic monk, a spiritually bereft atheist, or a tempestuous girlfriend, E. would realize his own inefficacy and fundamental unimportance in that person’s life. It was extremely difficult for E. to change his demeanor or the mood of his impetuous ‘bros’ once a few uplifting attempts had been defeated in a sufficiently morbid and unforgiving manner — he simply wasn’t man enough to say: ‘No asshole, you’re not going to feel this way, snap out of it!’. &nbsp;This listening, this intense coupling to the sadness of other people, sent E. into great distress when handling disputes between his relations; and, god forbid, if E. was ever faced with an ill sentiment of his own, he was the most pitifully meek beggar you’d ever see.</div><div style="background-color: black; border: 0px; color: #bbbbbb; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20.016666412353516px; margin-bottom: 20px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 2.5em; vertical-align: baseline;">Ibrahim was the dynamo of the whole room, he was the tornado that stirred S. and E. up into the air like two flimsy dust bunnies. He could bark those two into shameful submission within seconds; and when I. had a bad day the roommates would tremble in fear. Unequalled was I.’s ability to control an atmosphere, to dominate the inklings and understanding of his antagonists, insinuating exactly as he intended to. I. had a gift for non-verbal, visceral communication, which was taught to him by an even more aloof, hopelessly inscrutable man — the father (or so I. named him). Luckily, the storm of I. rarely came and when those dark moments passed he was a &nbsp;rambunctious, boisterous buffoon. I. had a talent for grinning: staring at girls until they could no longer suppress a guilty giggle. He would nudge dudes in the ribs to make some horribly inappropriate, ribald joke about the contours of a nearby female or some immanent, eminent, priapic symbolism. I., was the marquee guest at high society parties, the ‘hors concours’ of unspoken fun and sexual revelation. I. was a great time, so they said.</div><div style="background-color: black; border: 0px; color: #bbbbbb; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20.016666412353516px; margin-bottom: 20px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 2.5em; vertical-align: baseline;">Why introduce these three young bachelors one may ask? Well, after a certain amount of rambling about the city and having all the bacchanal fun there was to be had, they decided to go on Holiday. ‘To clean up my act’ is what I. would say, encouraging the other two to enter into an adventure with him. They decided, the three of them, to construct a perfectly clean and wonderful apartment, the most luxurious incubation box one could think of. In this sterile environment, they would cleanse themselves with productive, titivating pursuits such as exercise, reading, sleeping, and eating — to emerge better men. The grooming of the room, so to speak, was hard work.</div><div style="background-color: black; border: 0px; color: #bbbbbb; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20.016666412353516px; margin-bottom: 20px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 2.5em; vertical-align: baseline;">More later… (involving headbashing)</div></div></div>
