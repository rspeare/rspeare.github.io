Went to school just now during recess to say goodbye to everyone at school. A little strange of a situation, since I never gave a formal goodbye and that travel plans have been waiting for megans word: however, i have to say the goodbye was a little dissapointing.<br /><br />I recieved one hug from the school director after a short discurso, or words of thanks in spanish to the school. In general, no one really seems to care that IÂ´m leaving but maybe this is the way things work here. Travelers come and go and its not worth getting to worked up. Although I do recall much more sentiment goodbyes given to zoe, laurel, and thomas. Bummer, should have made more jokes.<br /><br />On the other side, very excited to travel to antigua and wait for megan tomorrow. Should be the final chapter in these 3 months in guatemala. Xela has been an incredible place to meet people and learn spanish. Very thankful for the conocimientos that were placed in each day by chance. Actually just a saw a sweet holland girl who i had met before who is also travelling. Her goodbye was much more heartfelt...
