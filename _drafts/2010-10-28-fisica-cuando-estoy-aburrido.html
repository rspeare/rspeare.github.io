So I am very bored working at the bar tonight. So let's review some physics formalism.<div><br /></div><div>Quantum mechanics can best be described by an infinite vector space equipped with a dot product. A vector space has the following properties:</div><div>additivity - a + b = c</div><div>commutative - a + b = b + a</div><div>associative - (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)</div><div>there exists a zero/null vector - 0</div><div>for each vector there exists an inverse - a + (-a) = 0</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, these properties work easily in our normal set up of complex numbers, however with more complicated number set ups, such as complex numbers with multiple components these will not work and that really stinks, so even though the previous statements sound stupid, they are very very important!</div><div><br /></div><div>Now I will use braquet notation to represent these vectors. This helps simplify dot products and other vector operations.</div><div><br /></div><div>A valid vector space also has scalar multiplication and distributive multiplication:</div><div>2|a> = |2a> </div><div>2(|a> + |b>) = |2a> + |2b></div><div><br /></div><div>A vector space with these braquet vectors can be split up into linearly independent vectors. For example, 3 dimensional space can be divided into the vectors x y and z. No linear combination of x and y can create a vector in the z dimension, therefore x y and z are said to be linearly independent. x, y, and z and called the basis of 3 dimensional space, because together they span or fully describe all of the corresponding space. In quantum mechanics, there can be an infinite number of vectors, or a space with an infinite number of dimensions called a hilbert space. But there is a huge requirement on a hilbert space to keep it well contained called the dot product, and normalization.</div><div><br /></div><div>And inner product can be written:</div><div><a|b> = <b|a>* or <a|a> > 0</div><div>This means that an inner product is symetric and that it is also positive definite. Meaning the a vector inner product with itself is greater than or equal to zero. The inner product is 0 if and only if the vector itself is 0 or the vectors are orthogonal.</div><div>it is similar to the mathematical formula |a||b|cos(theta) where theta is the angle between the two vectors and a and b are the absolute values of the vector magnitudes. A norm, or the corresponding idea of length/value of a vector is described as:</div><div>sqrt(<a|a>)       (square root = sqrt)</div><div>this quantity is the basically the length of a vector. If this length/norm is equal to one, then it is said to be normalized. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
