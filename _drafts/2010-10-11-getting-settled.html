So, this hostel is pretty amazing. For the exact same price as living with a family, I have a private bathroom, 2 complimentary meals a day, a nice clean bed on the second floor in a private room, free wifi and computer use, cable television, and a sweet cafe on the roof where I plan on spending a lot of time.<br /><br />Just went out to dinner tonight with laurel, jaime, and luis. We went to a really nice french restaurant where I tried olives for the first time and actually liked them. It is strange watching laurel interact with these men, because it is obvoius that they want to date her but she just kind of eggs them on. What a heartbreaker, just like my sisters. A piece of advice to those girls out there who have men wrapped around their fingers, dont use men to buy you dinners and take out too much, its just plain unfair (or to use them as cheap friends and sounding boards for emotions when they really want a relationship). Yes guys can be brute and stupid, but girls can be ignorant and manipulative of others desires... just a vented emotion from tonights experience<br /><br />Im really excited for going back to the room and watching tv tonight before going to bed, found a spanish equivalent of the discovery channel along with some cool magazines. Need to make another push to improve the spanish, but unfortunately after the weekend at san pedro speaking only english, it is difficult to think fluidly in spanish once again. To everyone at home, I miss you very much. I know that mom and kate would love this hostel, meg, I think it{s a little to roughin it for you :)
