What is Guassian Curvature? It is a measure of the curvature of a 2-dimensional surface. Represented by the letter K, it is the reciprocal of the product of the two principal radii of curvature:<br /><br />K = 1 / (ab)<br /><br />Where a and b are the principal radii.<br /><br />Here's an example, a sphere of radius R has curvature 1 / R^2 because the principle radii of curvature in the x and y direction are both R. <br /><br />A CYLINDER, on the other hand, has 0 curvature. Why is this? Well a cylinder R may curve around a principle radius R in one direction, but it does not curve at all in its lengthwise direction. This means that the radius of curvature is infinite in the lengthwise direction! So 1 / infinity is, 0. <br /><br />Another way to think about this is a sheet of paper. If you place a sheet of paper flat on your desk and examine it, you'll see that both radii of curvature are infinite, because simply the paper is not curving! If you fold this paper into a cylinder, you have deformed the flat sheet of paper, but Gaussian curvature is conserved under 'continuous deformation'. Meaning, you would have to fold that paper or crinkle it somehow in order to make a sphere with non-zero curvature.<br /><br />Same thing with a map of the World! Think about the earth as a sphere of some sheet. Let's call it a spherical map. if you try to continuously deform that spherical map into a 2-d map, you'll find it's impossible without tearing the map! So, the gaussian curvature is conserved under 'continuous deformation' - gaussian curvature is a characteristic quantity in topology. <br /><br />The Guass-Bonnet theorem says that the integral of Guassian curvature over an objects surface is equal to 4pi ( 1 - g ). Where g is something called the genus. We'll find the genus simply represents the number of 'holes' in a surface. More on this next time.
