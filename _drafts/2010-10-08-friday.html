Whew, the end to another week in Xela. So yesterday was very interesting. Went to school at 8 in the morning after a pretty uncomfortable run... chocolate and guatemalan beans do not mix well... After studying with my maestra-making hourly trip to the bathroom throne, my stomach finally felt better and we went into town to check out a pretty important holiday celebrating santa rosaria, the saint of xela. The story goes that she ws praying in the church one day and basically became like a stone, no one was able to mover her from a kneeled position. And so she stayed in xela.<br /><br />After classes, went home for lunch and to talk to jovita. Went back for a salsa class at 230, which was actually fun but quite difficult. Most american and english music is paced in 4´s and 2´s, whereas salsa is centred around 3 beats, so one must be very patient with the feet. Not to mention that it is almost completely up to the guy to guide the girl on the dancefloor during salsa... But, hey this white boy held his own.<br /><br />After the salsa class went home to rest for a bit, then went out for run. Just for the heck of it, i stopped by the boxing gym since I hadn´t been there for 2 days. So i entered and the entrenador oscar laughed at me for running there. He still doesn´t think i can understand spanish very well, but i i actually understand all the gringo jokes or advice he gives me. After sparring with a somewhat overzealous latino youngster who was much quicker and more experienced than me, i recieved a little bit of a beating, which made oscar giggle  and stop the sparring, asking ``roberto, estas bien``... uno minuto coach let me catch my breath.<br /><br />After running home with really friggin heavy arms, i had a nice dinner with jovita and her friend from school, in which we talked about lost loves. Great romance stories in guatemala.<br /><br />Then, i went to a party benefitting quetzaltrekkers, a non profit hiking group in xela. My fellow students and i met up and walked there, where i finally showed my friends that i wasn´t such a stick in the mud for never going out late night. That being said, i didn´t drink anything but that doesn´t mean this white boy didn´t break it down in his hiking boots.<br /><br />This morning, woke up exhausted but proud of yesterday. Today has been more relaxed, taking a walk with jovita and now waiting to go to the gym in downtown xela. I kind of hope none of the other guys notice my somewhat blue eye from last night, but i actually wear it with pride. Trying new things and having a great time. While being safe, always. Missing mama and papa, megan and pookie.
