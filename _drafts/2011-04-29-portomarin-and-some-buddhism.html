So, the last couple of days on the camino have been fantastic. Sitting in portomarin right now with Benny and Toby listening to music after a nice thjndestorm. really am trying to soak up this experience now, realizing they I have only a week left in Europe and then it's back home. <br /><br />Talked to south Africans quite a bit recently who both work at a Buddhist retreat. They passed along some great thoughts that I thought I would share:<br /><br />Buddha said when you die your life will be the product of all that you have thought<br /><br />Appreciate this breath, because once you take it in, there will never be another like it. No other breath will be paired with the same sensations or emotions. A lesson in that all things are impermanent.<br /><br />Tried to focus on these two things while walkingthe last couple days - even when every breath involved the suffocating smell of fresh horse and cow manure!<br /><br />It is a great practice though. To appreciate this very moment and squeeze everything you can out of it. Or when now sucks, realize that it's just a matter of time before things change for the better.<br /><br />Also Buddha said "don't believe anything everything I tell you, in fact don't believe everything you see, but believe everything that you feel." experience is the best teacher. I think this shows great humility for a guy like Buddha who had people crawling over him for advice. I think it also means that the best way to learn and create your philosophy for life is to go out and live, to experience the world. To feel the good and the bad in an intense, instructive manner. <br /><br />Although im not a Buddhist, I really am fascinated by some of it's ideas. And it's fun to go religious grocery shopping within some of it's important guidelines.<br /><br />Looking forward to arriving in santiago, only ninety kilometers remain and the trip has really flown by. Sad to leave this great outdoor lifestyle and all the adventure but That being said, I can't wait to get back home. To run in the woods, to drink frappuccinos, to cook with mom, hang with the boys, to read, to shower, to sleep without snorers. <br /><br />Got to play the hero today on the camino. We saw a dog who had broken it's back legs and was lying in a river far from town. Shivering and miserable, it was hard to watch this poor dog. Some other pilgrims asked me to run back to town and ask someone to send help or at least put the dog out of its misery. I went and cAlled the police, then ran back to Toby and crew who were nice enough to hold my bag. We stayed with the dog for a whole waiting but eventually left him with a nice German man who said he would wait for the police. <br /><br />Schopenhauer once said, a dog is mans best reminder to stay focused on the present and is his best remedy for pessimism.
