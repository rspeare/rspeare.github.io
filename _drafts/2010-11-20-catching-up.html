OK, to catch up!<div><br /></div><div>So i have been back in Xela now for another week. Life is very good. Recent daily schedule</div><div>first, wake up and go to the nearby cafe for a frappuccino or bebida fria. Then<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15.6px; "> read the newspaper and write down new vocabulary for classes.</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15.6px; "> Go to school with marlen, chat in spanish and review vocab sometimes walk through the city. At 10:30 we</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15.6px; "> break for coffee and cookies with all the casa xelaju peeps. </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15.6px; ">1pm finish classes go home for lunch. G</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15.6px; ">o to the gym/go for a run in the afternoon after a nap or a trip to the internet cafe. Then</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15.6px; "> dinner/social hour outside the hostel or with gio up the bar. </span></div><div><br /></div><div>It's been a simple life. Been studying a lot. learning a lot about Computer architecture, as inspired by some of my meetings with some motorcyclists who are passing through Guatemala. About a week ago, I met a google fanatic like myself who was a actually a programmer.. He is riding his bike from chicago all the way to argentina. YOu can check out his website at atlasrider.com . Really really smart guy. He gave me lots of tips on how to bike across the US and some of teh camping gear/methods that you need. Also, met two canadian bikers who were travelling from vancouver island to panama. They were some really nice guys and we got to talking almost every morning in the cafe.</div><div><br /></div><div>Haven't been introspecting too much recently because of all the studying, but here is what I learned this week that is really cool:</div><div><br /></div><div>the clock rate, or rate at which the logical processing unit or CPU inside most video game systems nowadays runs so fast that it can literally melt the circuits with such a high frequency. therefore, monster systems like the xbox 360 and playstation 3 use what's called gating to literally shut down portions of the machine when not in use. This saves a ton of power output. </div><div><br /></div><div>Nowadays, our CPU's run so fast that random access memory or RAM can't keep up because it is physically impossible to transfer information quickly enough from two discrete locations to keep up with the computing power of logical units nowadays. Therefore, register speed or bus speed, the quick acting memory is what seems to be the ultimate obstacle in computing power nowadays. this is called the von neumman bottleneck.</div><div><br /></div><div>the father of modern computing Alan Turing, was killed by an apple filled with cyanide. It is possible that it was murder, suicide, or accident; however it is suggested that the logo for apple corporation was inspired by his death. Alan Turing was the guy who came up with the idea to put programs in the same place as memory, therefore creating the idea of software and making computers much more flexible/malleable for different tasks. </div><div><br /></div><div>bill told me that google gets its server computing power by sheer quantity and simplicity of its system. They manufacture chip boards with velcro to the back that they literally place onto big sticky server walls. When these chips are busted, they just rip em off and put on a new one!</div><div><br /></div><div>RAM or random access memory is basically the third tier in computer architecture. Computers in the old days had to scroll through all preceding memory in order to arrive at a specific address, making the memory access extremely slow. Random access means that access is completely free, you can simply type in an adress and read the information. Imagine having to scroll through all of your childhood and adolescent memories to arrive at one moment?! that would suck right? The problem with random access memory is that its bitwise memory (0 or 1) is stored and driven by capacitors, which slowly dissipate electricity over time. Therefore, once the power goes out, all ram is lost. This is the difference between sleeping and hibernating for a computer. If am not mistaken, sleeping is when recent information is still in the RAM due to a running current.</div><div><br /></div><div>When RAM is overloaded, the computer often takes the oldest piece of information and places it on a lower tier of memory. This is called paging, and normally happens when there are a lot of programs running. Repeatedly paging a computer or overloading its RAM is called thrasing, which eventually builds up serious problems. </div><div><br /></div><div>Now there are some differences between RAM, there is dynamic which requires constant current since it relies on only one transistor, equipped with a capacitor to store bits; and there is static RAM which is much longer lasting but needs 6 transistors for each bit and therefore cannot reach as a high of a density.</div><div><br /></div><div>Flash memory is really friggin sweet, it was invented in the 1980's by some sweet japonese dude, it is basically unaffected by physical stimulus and extremely space efficient. The Iphone 3gs uses only flash memory unlike most computers which use a hard disk to store info. </div><div><br /></div><div>Internet servers devour 5% of US energy. This is because they are basically giant computer that have to constantly be running and constantly be cooled!</div><div><br /></div><div>The US has the largest Solar Power station in the world in the mojave desert, it produces 350MW through concentrated beams heated what's called a working liquid in a central tower. It's power output is almost three times the second biggest plant which is stationed in sonolvo spain. (ha take that!)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mennonites know how to make really good pumpkin bread :) </div><div><br /></div><div>Wish that I had some philosophizing to do tonight but unfortunately I have been focused on other things. Trying to be mindful every day, not to be preoccupied by the future or attached to the past. Living in the moment.</div>
