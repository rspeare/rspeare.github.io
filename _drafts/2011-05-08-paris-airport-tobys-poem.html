Sitting in bed now at six o clock in the morning. Too excited to sleep. Can't wait to see mom and dad. Can't wait to see Kate and Meg.<br /><br />Had an awkward goodbye with Toby yesterday but "hugs" aren't really forte. Toby is such a sensitive and motivated person. He is drive. To do many things in life and I am so glad to have met him and been able to learn some things with him. A poem that he gave me, which I have now memorized is a kind of mantra for a life well lived - take what you want from it:<br /><br />Be good, and if god wills it so be great.<br />The first is all in all, the last must wait,<br />Till time awards the final estimate<br /><br />"I ought" will lead you Higher than "I would"<br />And s lo it is, how rarely understood<br />Good to be great but greater to be good
