Spent all day yesterday reading stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald. This man loves writing about the aristocratic, excessively social and excessively bored youth. <div><br /></div><div>My personal favorite of all of his short stories so far must be the 'Ice Palace', which describes a young beautiful Georgia girl who is whisked off to New York, Yankee country. Many of the local southern boys ask her why? Why are leaving our town to go north with this successful hooligan and leave us all here? (They are obviously a bit insulted by the girls rejection of their lifestyle). </div><div><br /></div><div>After only a few days in NY, she becomes quickly disillusioned and realizes that the harsh cold of the north, the privacy and formality of so may Yankee men makes her uncomfortable. Her future husband offers no respite from this social awkwardness. She begins to miss the warmth of her own home and the history of her southern family. Everything she finds within her fiancee's house is so new and without personality. The rooms are immaculately decorated with leather couches, sofas, reading chairs and paintings, but none of them hold the same memories as her home furniture. She begins to miss her fathers study which contains books, chairs and guns that have been passed down through the family for generations. New York is beautiful on the surface but a vacuum on the inside. </div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span> The story ends in her admiration of a beautiful 'ice palace' that was constructed for Christmas. While taking a tour with her Fiancee inside this palace, she becomes lost and almost dies of hypothermia, locked within the frigid walls. She of course screams at her husband after this debacle: "take me home! take me home now!". The story ends with her once again perched on the windowsill of her father's house, biting a peach and waiting for a southern boy to come round and pick her up. </div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>So many of F. Scott Fitzgerald's female characters are devastatingly charming, beautiful and egocentric. Their emotions are often fickle and damaging to their poor young suitors. They can idealize a long lost love for years and then surprisingly change their mind within a matter of minutes during the long-awaited reunion. As a man slowly reveals more of himself to her, undressing his coy and gaurded personality which was at first so attractive, her mind begins to drift off to other 'beaux's' - and she becomes BORED. Oh what a terrible tragedy for a person to open themselves up and find only boredom and disgust at the other end. </div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>However, unlike many of F. Scott's other female characters this girl in the 'Ice Palace' has the gusto to forego worldly excitements and return to her roots. She accepts her hometown boys who may never achieve great things financially or professionally. But, they have the charm and the history of the south. 'Ice Palace' is one of the less romantically devastating stories within this short story book.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
