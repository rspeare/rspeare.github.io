Just got into Burgos today. And thenold crew is here! Great to be back with the young crowd. Evan and Jessica and Toby have spent a rest day in Burgos after kicking uP he pace a bit. Also met up with Maria and her dad jim. Montana, Texas, Arizona, and England are represented in this group. The albergue is very nice, finally get to wash some clothes properly. Got a nice a bed above a sled proclaimed snorer from quebec. Life is good.
