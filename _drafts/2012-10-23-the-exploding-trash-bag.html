<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Like a truculent pet faced with the imminent departure of its caretaker, my apartment unleashed a volley of detritus onto my shins, calves, socks and sandals this evening -- I leave on vacation in the morning.<br /><br />This vindictive action brought many relational concerns to my attention, making me recognize the intricacies and delicate language involved in a home, home-maker, relationship. I have not had a similar, silent bond since a childhood dog named Phoebe. In many ways, these two creatures-- my apartment and my late Phoebe -- are analogous to one another: they are both capricious and&nbsp;temperamental&nbsp;when hungry for food or attention; they both speak plainly through body language and demeanor; they both have a propensity for gluttonous acts, manifesting in the appearance of candy wrappers and ice cream pints on the floor; and finally, they both have a deep, fundamental independence, which reveals itself at the most inopportune times. When I'm disgustingly needy for affection and make mawkish attempts to cuddle, my Phoebe (and my apartment) turns her head away and squirms to the other side of the bed. This precarious intimacy between my room, and its predecessor -- that of my Phoebe -- proves to be a daily challenge in self-control.<br /><br />The altercation began with pre-travel cleaning and grooming. When faced with her monthly bath, my Phoebe's eyes would turn sullen and downcast; her fur would droop and sag with the hot water, and her whole body seemed to despair. I tried to assuage her pain by guiltily crooning over her, but to no use. In that moment her little heart was lost : but, Phoebe had great resilience. Immediately after the faucet was turned off, my Phoebe would frantically pace about the bath tub; looking for the slightest chance of escape and the consequential flight down the hallway, pining for a dry piece of furniture on which to rub her furry hips. I would lay towels down for the sodden mutt, and as she dove onto those strewn salvations from wetness, I would excitedly jump on top of her and brush furiously with an extra dry towel. She would growl and moan ecstatically, enraptured by her release from the bath-rigmarole.&nbsp;There is no such "drying catharsis" during my cleaning chores with this studio apartment, it only takes on a morose and austere air after the act. Perhaps this dark demeanor is caused by my neglect of its more intimate needs; I have certainly been able to detect a&nbsp;harbored&nbsp;ill-will and dissatisfaction with my feng shui.Whether or not this underlying point of contention was the cause for tonight's explosion, I don't know; like all close relationships one can only hint and guess at the primary motivations for a fight -- but without a doubt, my apartment was incipiently pissed tonight.<br /><br />At first I engaged the dishes, the most fundamental aspect of a working domestic marriage. The sink was stridently clanking silverware and seething bitterly beneath the sudsy water -- baying and hissing at my&nbsp;hygienic disregard. The spoons were effacing Nutella and curry reluctantly, holding on to each minute particle with recalcitrant desperation. I made it through this process with little injury and moved on to Vacuum the floor. The rejected corners and crannies spat an endless stream of dust bunnies, candy wrappers, silver coins, and old notes -- the perfect fusillade of vacuum-cloggers. I ducked and weaved the suction-head between these trash pieces, but eventually a shot struck home and I was forced to turn off my choking machine: the apartment won that round. I deigned to genuflect and scrubbed each and every floor-tile with my bare servile hands; indulging the emotional despotism of my residential antagonist.<br /><br />But the work and angst wasn't over yet. The final step of this grooming and cleansing process was to carefully compile and take out the trash. I assembled my forgotten foodstuffs and wrappers, all the evidence of a porcine-bachelor existence. My flimsy trash bags grew to tremendous size, and I watched with indifference as the tenuous black plastic strained and stretched across convex objects. The baggage of my relationship, had quite literally been festering and effervescing in those black bags for weeks; and I, being reluctant to address the issue, let those seeds of discord concoct a squalid potion of vitriol. I never thought to release that terrible, building pressure and so had sewn my fate. As I spun and tied the heap of trash sacks, the black membrane gave way, and the dirty history of my relations with this room were belched all over over my legs.<br /><br />Phoebe used to puke too, but it was in a cute, endearing way. There was always a foregoing convulsion and set of groans that heralded the coming of bile. I would mop it up afterwards and console her. She would regretfully, thankfully look into my eyes.<br /><br />There was no such reconciliation between me and my apartment. The air has gotten colder today, and I can see the putrid stains from last night. I leave in a few minutes for Nepal -- hopefully absence makes the heart grow fonder (of living space).<br /><br /><br /></div>
