<br /><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The worst enemies are those that go bump in the night. Children call them monsters, goblins, demons, giants, creatures, and for some, pokemon. Adults call them bed bugs, nightmares, insomnia, worry, and loneliness. Sleep is a time of release, and for those who are pestered by the prenominal pillow bullies, I feel for you. Without rest, without being able to put our guard down for a brief instant, we grow raw and torpid, easily peeved and unable to engage the life around us. Sleep is a reservoir, from which we derive great physical and emotional energy. When we are deprived of this pool we are not ourselves.<br /><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I’ve suffered two instances of rampant sleep deprivation in my life; one by the piercing beak of bed bugs in Guatemala, one by the stirring itchiness of sun poisoning – the latter of which is self-diagnosed, but who cares after all, it’s the lack of shut-eye that matters. These two instances taught me a great deal about the importance of sleep, and how destitute we are without it.<br /><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I’m currently sitting at the keyboard with a blue gel ice pack wrapped about my left forearm in gauze, attempting to sedate my epidermal nerve receptors so that a searing flash of itchy heat stops running from my shoulder to my fingers. Spent a few too many hours outside at the beach the other day, and my skin is making me pay for it. What does an ‘itch’ feel like? particularly a bad one, like Poison Oak or Ivy, or an allergic reaction to some substance? It’s a pinching crescendo, a call from the skin for nails to scratch and pull and scrape away the pain – only leading to more pinching, and more burning, and more madness. Nonlinear growth is a nasty thing. Well, I’ve been without sleep or very much comfort for the past 24 hours. No 10-second period passes by without a feeling of tiny pricks in my skin, just begging to be excavated with my scratching paws. Jesus, just writing this makes me itchy.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I’ve downed some Benadryl – and by some I mean a lot – put on a shit ton of Aloe Vera lotion. Nothing seems to help. And, herein lies the really scary part of a skin condition or any mentally interrupting ailment that robs you of sleep &amp; concentration: what if it’s all in your head? What if there&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;no medicine for what you’ve got, and you are creating this stubborn affliction all by your masochistic subconscious self? Considering this, you suddenly feel powerless and silly, because there is a possibility that you could get it all to stop, all the pinches and burns and pricks and tickles, by sheer force of will. But we’re not all that strong. Hardly anyone is, in fact. [Although, I’ve met one person in my life who is strong enough to pummel Poison Ivy &amp; Oak into the ground, to abstain from enraptured excoriation, thereby defeating the ‘itch’ through ascetic conduct – my mother.]<br /><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">How inadequate we feel under the despotic rule of an itch, knowing that we could turn the tables at any moment and lie&nbsp;<i>still.</i>&nbsp;But this is not in my nature, nor is it the nature of many human beings. It is very difficult to do nothing in the face of a problem—to do less. And so, I’ve itched and scratched my way into self-pitying paroxysm and moaning formication -- writhing in my bed while this fire crawls over my skin.<br /><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Any skin affliction that constantly pulls and pinches one’s conscience is a destroyer of sleep. The formication fire only grows more intense as the night hours linger, and the most desperate circumstance is when the inpatient cannot predict the end. When will the burn subside and when can I return to sleep? When can I finally rest, for more than a few seconds between intermittent bursts of epidermal temptation? In such situations, the best policy is to try and remain calm and accept your fate. Try to be patient and even complacent, like the twitching, flea-ridden dog – as gross a metaphor as that is – or the tail-swinging donkey amongst horse flies. Those things that attack us when we are ready to release and put down our guard, easing into dream, are the most nefarious of enemies.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I’ve gone with less than 2 hours of sleep for 5 days before, during a trip to Mammoth Lakes California for college Cross Country training. I arrived with great emotional and physical alacrity, ready to throw myself at the trails and the new teammates with whom I would be living with – in a cabin – for 4 weeks. But alas, I was too quick to the trigger in both instances. My voluble nature earned some asperity from a freshman cohort, and my eagerness to run fast and strong and out front resulted in lactate-infused legs, a sore calf and severe sunburn. As night fell over the first day of training out west, I noticed a searing, undulating pinch in my thighs, which made me twitch and turn at the dinner table. Upon entering into bed and pulling the sheets over my exhausted body, I found that no more than 5 minutes could go by without my back spasming, as I tried to restrain myself from ferociously digging into my legs with fingernails. This was not good for sleep. Hours went past, and I ambled about the house, twitching and curling my spine every now and then beneath the strident sensorimotor calls of my skin.&nbsp; By the end of the week, I had resorted to playing chess late into the night and sleeping out on the porch in a sleeping bag – somehow the fresh, cool night air was satisfying to my skin and the stars made my problem seem small. I would call my mother just before bed, asking her – trying not to cry – to schedule an early flight home. I had had enough of college training for that summer.<br /><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Montaigne says that a measure of a man is how well he sleeps. The emperors of Rome, Alexander the great, and the Philosophers of antiquity slept like babes. I am a very light but sound sleeper. Because of this lightness, this nocturnal sensibility, my ‘greatness’ lies in precarious balance. I can be thrown into despair and self-loathing by the slightest irritation.<br /><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">But besides itchiness and autoimmune afflictions, there is also the question of enemies, real enemies that lurk in the night. My only experience lies with insects – bed bugs – whose rostrum pierced my thighs – yes, the thighs once again – late in the night as I lay beneath multiple wool blankets in the mountainous city Quetzaltenango, Guatemala.&nbsp; At first I thought I had leg acne. Then came the pricks and bites in the night and the concomitant red splotches splayed across my ‘muslos’. Yes, it was all very distracting. Over time, the lack of faith in my own bed and blankets corrupted my composure and self-confidence – thank you, you insidious pests! Bed bugs are famous for a reason: they disturb us when our defenses are down and rob us of the ability to catch true rest. Yes, they are the worst type of enemy, the type that catches you with your pants down – literally – during every attack.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">But, I started this little entry in search of an answer to the question ‘why is sleep so important to us?’. It’s a physical necessity and an emotional reservoir; a place where we can engage life’s problems on a marginal, subconscious level or escape from everything entirely. But things go bad when we either cannot have this respite -- thanks to some insect, real or imaginary, crawling over our skin -- or, when we delve too deep into dreams and lose our place in the world.<br /><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Strangely enough, before going to Guatemala, where I was robbed of a great deal of sleep, I had spent 40 days sleeping 12 hours a day. Maybe it was karma. Trouble was, both sleep schedules were no good. When you sleep to forget or to distract and spend the majority of your time and conscious energy in the dream world, the real one can turn into a nightmare; one that you shrink from more and more with each passing night. Robert Penn Warren describes this process as the ‘Great Sleep’ in&nbsp;<i>All the King’s Men</i><br /><i><br /></i></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><em>"In any case, he laid aside the journal and entered upon one of the periods of the Great Sleep. He would come home in the evening, and because he knew that he could not work he would go to bed immediately. He would sleep twelve hours, fourteen hours, fifteen hours, feeling himself, while asleep, lunge deeper and deeper into sleep like a diver groping downward into dark water feeling for something which may be there and which would glitter if there were any light in the depth, but there isn't any light. Then in the morning he would lie in bed, not wanting anything, not even hungry, hearing the small sounds of the world sneaking and seeping back into the room, under the door, through the glass, through the cracks in the wall, through very pores of the wood and plaster."</em><br /><em><br /></em></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Like divers, we push deeper and deeper into sleep, searching for salvation but sometimes only push the surface further away, and when all light disappears, and you don’t know up from down, left from right, then you’re really in trouble. Too much sleep, too much comfort is a bad thing. My mother was right to whack me ‘out of it’ during a deep dive into sleep many years ago. One can become lost in sleep, and so pain has its place. It keeps us alive and alert. Keeps us appreciative of the good things that come when agitation subsides. (Those bed bugs may not have been so bad after all; I might’ve slept the day away without their coercion.) I live in a place where some individuals are seemingly always asleep: they float along the streets each day, bathing in the tepid salts of complacency and uninspired affluence. They are somnambulating.<br /><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I am a masochist at heart. I need pain and poor circumstance to make me writhe and expand as a person. The past few weeks have been a period of sustained rest, but also of growing restlessness and an impatience for duty. I was withering beneath luxury before this stint of itchiness; perhaps I should be thankful. A slight mistrust of the bed is a good thing.</div>
