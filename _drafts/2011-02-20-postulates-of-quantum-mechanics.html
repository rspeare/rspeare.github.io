I hate function spaces. Been here at Starbucks frustrated for a while now, but finally starting to make some headway on an easier textbook. Let's review the basic postulates of Quantum Mechanics!<br /><br />1) The state of a particle, can be represented by a normalized vector \Psi in the Hilbert space L2.<br /><br />What does this mean? Well, a Hilbert space is a complete inner product space. Hmmm... okay the word complete. A complete space is one in which there is nothing 'missing'. So for example the set of Real Numbers is supposed to be complete. But, this is constructed of multiple parts. First of all, there are integers 1,2,3,4, etc. Then there are rationals, which are ratios of integers such as 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, etc. But there are Real Numbers that cannot be described using these ratios of integers such as the square root of two or Pi. These are called "irrational" numbers and can only be described using limits.<br /><br />To define what is "complete" more technically; a complete metric space is one in which all cauchy sequences converge. So what the heck does 'cauchy' mean? A cauchy sequence is one in which the higher index terms become very very close to one another, or that their difference converges to 0. This 'cauchy' property is a requirement for any converging sequence/series because if the final terms continued to be different from one another, then the sum would continue to change instead of hitting a stable value.<br /><br />But these cauchy sequences don't necessarily converge, because the value may not exist in the space you're working in(won't get into that now). The important thing is that Real numbers include all converging limits of rational numbers and therefore it is cauchy complete. This is really important in calculus, and the reason why we can take derivatives and integrals of functions (ahem which are described by converging limits most often).<br /><br />Now, we know that the Hilbert space is complete, so it includes all cauchy sequences. This is really important because many quantum mechanical particles are described by infinite summations or linear superpositions of different wavefunctons, with discrete Energy values.<br /><br />Next up, inner product space? Well this means that within this Hilbert space, we can take two elements/ vectors and take their inner product. An inner product is a symmetric, positive definite, linear, operation.<br />symmetric: <a|> = <b|><br />positive definite <a|> is greater than 0<br />linear: <a> = <a|> + <b|c> (and scalar multiplication to, such as multiplying by some random constant)<br /><br />Now, if all this is satisfied, we've got ourselves a Hilbert space. We need the completeness to include linear superpositions of wave-functions (or vectors in this space), and we need the inner product in order to apply linear operators and get real numbers (aka measurements), or use the statistical interpretation.<br /><br />2) Observable Quantities are represented by Hermitian operators<br />So now that were working with a Hilbert space, equipped with an inner product, we can apply an operator to a vector in order to yield what's called an eigenvalue. This means that if we have an operator Q applied to the eigenvector v, we are essentially multiplying v by a constant (eigenvalue). This eigenvalue is normally denoted with the variable lambda, but unfortunately I don't know how to typeset that char into html... so lets use l. example:<br />Q|v> = l|v> <div>Since this operator is hermitian we can apply it to both sides and yield the same eigenvalue (as long as the vector is the same).</div><div><v|qv> = <qv|v> = l <v|v> = l (1) = l</v|v></qv|v></v|qv></div><div>Now remember, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are very special things. In general, vectors are linear combinations of eigenvectors and therefore the application of an operator Q can yield a bunch of crazy stuff. What's unique about an eigenvector is that the application of an operator does not change the direction of the vector itself, it only multiplies it by a constant. For example, take some general vector g that can be described as a linear combination of a bunch fo eigenvectors:</div><div>g = v1 + v2 + v3</div><div>When we apply q, we get:</div><div>Q|g> = l1|v1> or l2|v2> or l3|v3></div><div>We have no idea of predicting what g will turn into! This is what is so crazy about quantum mechanics, by applying an operator (or 'measuring' it) we collapse the wavefunction into one of its eigenvectors.</div><div><br /></div><div>So ultimately we would have a hard time finding out what eigenvectors are constructing g, just from this measurement. </div><div><br /></div><div>Luckily a vector space and in fact any operator can be what's called diagonalized (change its effect to just multiplying by a constant) simply by changing basis. A basis is the collection of vectors that span the whole space. </div><div><br /></div><div>Now it is a simple but very important fact of linear algebra that all hermitian operators yield real eigenvalues. The proof is pretty easy and you should try it out.</div><div><br /></div><div>So what does this have to do with real observables? Well, if you want the position of a quantum mechanical particle, you're best bet is to apply the hermitian operator that corresponds to x. This operation will essentially give  you a 'guess' as to what the average position of the particle would be given an infinite number of measurements, since the particles position is in fact never exact or certain. </div><div><br /></div><div>3) A measurement of an observable Q on a particle in state |Psi> (its wavefunction) is certain to return the value 'l' if and only if |Psi> is the eigenvector corresponding to l. </div><div><br /></div><div>This is a consequence of what we were talking about before. By measuring the particle we are essentially collapsing it into one of the eigenvectors, therefore we can only be sure of the measurement if the particle is ALREADY in one of these eigenstates! </div></b|c></a|></a></a|></b|></a|>
