<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Through the arched arabesque entrance of the Emirates Business class lounge, located on the fourth floor of the Dubai international airport, magnates mill around, roll rococo luggage, stake out red-brown tabletops and open their laptops, iPad cases, Blackberry and iPhone holsters. They use WiFi usernames and passwords that are engraved on golden tabletop placeholders, arranged like restaurant ‘reserved’ tags next to flower vases. Balance sheets and at <i>least</i> one cell phone litter the table-turned-desks.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="min-height: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There are regularly spaced feeding areas where piles of bananas, bagels, salmon and cream cheese, turkey, beef, pastrami and cheddar cheese are arranged in enticing orientations. Darkly iridescent prunes, walnuts, and bread loaves are displayed next to swirling flowers of unsalted butter that are strewn across piles of shaved ice. It’s a toothsome presentation, and the jaunty step of young businessmen in jeans and sport coats complete a palatial pre-flight cafeteria. Grounded stewards and stewardesses pincer chocolate croissants and muffins with silver tongs, arranging them next to bowls of wasabi wafers, three combinations of nuts and granny smith apples (red delicious apples as well, this observer was a bit biased). Glasses of orange juice, champagne, red &amp; white wine, port and scotch are left on empty tables, promptly picked up by Emirates staff with silver bussing platters. There are steaming bins of chicken sausage, and turkey sausage, and hash browns and omelets and sauces and jams, bubbling and seething like the patrons this café-lounge, who stare dead pan into cell phones, iPads, space, family members, or lap tops, pounding out Machiavellian transaction.</span></div><div style="min-height: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There is a somber tone to this café, and I wonder, what on earth did these patrons do to earn their illustrious tickets, and why are they so morose about it?</span></div><div style="min-height: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One could assume that a morbid sentiment in the business class lounge is due to the fact that <i>everyone</i> is pissed at an airport. Security and scanning and check-in and prolonged-spatial incarceration; stale food and stale air and stuttering mob movements; the solipsism-destroying requirement to be cowed in a cattle cortege, no matter how deep your pockets or understanding of travel expediencies: these are the shameful characteristics that link travel to sodomy – thanks to Southpark – and despair. What’s worse; such travel stressors are compounded into one’s bones by repetition. To the inveterate flyer, the travelling businessman, the airport terminal represents an insidious ablation of patience and individuality: the stochastic sadism of a lost bag or a lost visa, the animal disgust with a farting seatmate or a waffling &amp; apologetic customer service representative, inclement weather: flying is an exercise in feckless frustration. You are the world’s enemy if you are trying to get somewhere at a certain time. The purchase of a plane ticket represents only a simulacrum of power and punctuality – those who put too much faith in a boarding pass, or their elite status as ‘business’ or ‘first’ class, will be sorely disappointed.</span></div><div style="min-height: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The most content travellers are drifters, the types who don’t care about holding a schedule. Those who are content to sit (with or without a hemp backpack and dreadlocks) in the terminal and sleep (sipping smoothies or beers in the process), these are the happiest dilatory airport denizens. They are drones, placid dwellers, but are unlikely Business class passengers, because drifting is not conducive to business, or class.</span></div><div style="min-height: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Dubai Emirates Business class lounge is situated one floor above the economy class gates on a giant, glass enclosed, propitiously voyeuristic balcony. Throngs of peons can be seen below, swirling and clamoring around Starbucks and Nero’s coffee and duty free outlets. The illusion of being ‘above’ others is greatly diminished in Dubai however, because there is a multitude of business class passengers and one feels crowded in the lounge itself. In cities where snooty air traffic is rarely seen, business and first class lounges are often vacant and therefore more palatial: in Dubai and New York, you are one of the moneyed many.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="min-height: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The double disappointment of being on someone else’s schedule – the Pilot’s – and being obstructed by other equally self-righteous travellers – who are often on tighter, more important schedules than your own – causes one to stoically consume the sullied perks of the Business Class lounge and stare off in a disillusioned silence. Many feign concentration in these cafes, and this faux focus is a pantomime of the ‘see and be seen’ <i>scene</i> of a college party: no one looks at anyone else; each stews as a separate, inscrutable personality. Soon-to-be-Passengers pore into their computers and electronic media with an intensity that is reminiscent of Ivy League anal-retentive overachievers camping out in the Library – scrolling Facebook. This scrupulous, cool comportment of high –or low (depends on how you look at it)– class passengers is a coping mechanism for the human overestimation of self.</span></div><div style="min-height: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Perhaps I am being too hard on a group I don’t entirely understand; and yet, I have received smiles from babies, and baby’s families, from old couples that are returning home from abroad; we’ve talked about life and travel and food and books. Business class is much harder group. No smiles, no inter-passenger conversation: these would be deemed impudent and egregious marks of one who doesn’t belong. The jovial are the judged and the private are the pre-eminent.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="min-height: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But back to food.</span></div><div style="min-height: 12px;"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; white-space: pre;"> </span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There six types of caffeinated beverages one can concoct with the Emirates Business Class Lounge self-serve coffee machine. It is fully automated and contains theobrominic wonders like espresso, cafe Americano, cafe latte, decanter -- whatever that means -- milk latte, macchiato, cappuccino and latte macchiato. There are over fourteen different tea bags and an array of little tarts and scones to dip in said scalding libations.</span></div><div style="min-height: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Taking two doses of cappuccino and exploring the layout of the lounge, I come upon two shoe-shining stands, where cross-legged men sit in elevated black chairs and receive that awkwardly loin-level subservience; what I've always deemed semiotic for fellatio. I look down the walkway and see various restrooms and *showers*, where an attendant cleans the space after its use.</span></div><div style="min-height: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The extra elevation from the ‘economic’ third floor only places one closer to the plangent cries of boarding calls and missing passenger convocations, 'Mr. Wong. Please report to gate B18 for a departing flight to Beijing. Mr. Wong'. The separate entrance into the airplane for business class passengers is an elevated one, which requires both an a elevator and a slowly descending walkway to reach plane level – a gradual deigning to share cargo space with the proletariat. I look out over the various shops downstairs and pine after a Starbucks Frappuccino, the bought comfort of the past, as compared to the half-hearted self-brewed cappuccino of the my new group, the upper echelon. The snooty salmon aches in my stomach and I think, perhaps this is the cause of the perceived malcontent in that café: a lackluster buffet was the gustatory sacrifice for an exclusive, private space, but that space turned out to be not so exclusive, not so private.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="min-height: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As I stand on the out-looking precipice of the Business &amp; First Class ivory tower, the colorful roiling and conversing downstairs makes us – and by us I mean my other waiting-to-board passengers – seem quite sterile. We have been scheduled to leave at 8:30am; it is now 9:30am; and my privileged compatriots are not pleased. I see clients paternally shaking their heads at solicitous service staff. (How horrible it must be to act as an emotional punching bag for the most demanding – and fiscally important – of customers.)</span></div><div style="min-height: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Yes, this Salmon is most definitely going to be an in-flight problem. Does Business Class service include holding one's hair back? I mean, it's their fault. Right?</span></div><div><br /></div>
