Whew! Holy crap I hate overnight flights. Been walking around paris like a zombie today for 8 hours waiting for the check-in time at the hostel. Finally, i've gotten a 3hour nap in, I'll attempt to make it now until 11pm or midnight or whenever these other hostel hooligans go to bed. So what have I seen today? Well, there was the nice car ride with my good buddy Ryan and Marie through dirty jerz to Newark international airport. I hope Ryan has a good last couple of weeks at school, he deserves it. Immediately upon entering the airport alone, I was thrown into the exact same feeling I had when traveling to Guatemala - invisibility. Every other traveler looks right through another, hoping to complete their trip without any uncomfortable acquantances or inconveniences. This makes me feel very defensive as a coddled 22 year old American boy. I am not used to traveling and certainly not used to being away from friends and family. So, I put on my tough face and tried to act like I knew what I was doing (although more perceptive peeps would probably pick up on this and realize I was just some young guy away from his home and comfort zone)... and the baby face of mine doesn't help. Gotta work on some facial hair or something. Now the passengers to Paris were very interesting to people watch. The men in particular. Maybe this is a trend that I have not realized, but it seemed to me that I was surrounded by one of two dominant fashion statements: there was the masculo-feminine intellectual, wearing tight jeans, black t-shirt, some sort of fashionable boots and thick rimmed dark glasses. It seemed as though I dressed for this part, since I was wearing an old black synthetic t-shirt with dark blue jeans and 'hiking' boots. The other style was quite funny, being the more sporty type. Some of the more striking appearances were the adidas jump suit socker fans, and the baggy sweatsuit body builders, one of whom I stood behind at jamba juice and watched him buy 8 clif protein bars while he and his friend talked about protein intake in broken english. Once on the flight I was lucky enough to have my own aisle seat with on one beside. The plane was actually quite empty. However, the real lucky passengers were those who got to sit in the 3 seat middle aisle without any compadres beside them, they got to lay down during the flight! When I couldn't sleep, read the kindle about chemistry, watched NCIS, and the disney movie 'tangled'. Once in Paris I felt pretty good :) But, 2 hours after landing and walking between terminals trying to figure out the train system, I started to crash HARD. Thought about getting the whole travel thing over in one day and taking the TGV immediately to St. Jean Pie de Por but I wouldn't have made it, not to mention a TGV employee told me it would be better to take the train at 1:00 from paris. So, I bought a ticket to paris and arrived in Gare du Nord, walked down rue de dunkerque and here I am vintage hostel 73 rue de dunkerque Paris. Had a nice walk around the city this afternoon, took some great pictures but can't upload them right now because this computer is heavily protected. They have boxed in everything including USB ports! But you'll love these picks. There is a large hill that overlooks paris where I walked and there was a harp player with lots of people sitting on the step looking south over the city, it was very pretty, but I was a little too delirious to fully appreciate it, can't even recall the name. After the walk, finally came back around 4 and got into the room. I immediately set up camp, put on the blinders, the earplugs, and passed out for 3 hours. Now I can finally concentrate. Just for you mom if you're reading this, I bought this pastry that ended with 'framboise' it was jam spread between to thick biscuits, very good! And it allowed me to pass out afterwards. Good night guys, Missing you already.
