<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Studying the Poincare group this week in class, and because many thoughts are bubbling up, I'd like to write down a few things.<br /><br />A group is a very abstract thing that I thought was quite stupid as an undergraduate (not too long ago!). It is a set of elements, $a \epsilon G$ that are equipped with a multiplication operation -- which we call $*$ -- such that:<br /><br />\begin{eqnarray}<br />a * b \ \epsilon \ &nbsp;G\ \ \ \forall a,b\ &nbsp;\epsilon \ G<br />\end{eqnarray}<br /><br />Which means that a times b is an element of the group G, for all elements in G. This property means that the group is closed under multiplication. We also have that the multiplication operation is associative:<br /><br />\begin{eqnarray}<br />a*(b*c)=(a*b)*c<br />\end{eqnarray}<br /><br />and that there exists an identity element, such that<br /><br />\begin{eqnarray}<br />e * a = a \forall \ a \ \epsilon G<br />\end{eqnarray}<br /><br />We also need a proper inverse for all elements a, which send us back to the identity:<br /><br />\begin{eqnarray}<br />a*a^{-1} = e<br />\end{eqnarray}<br /><br />Well \textbf{that's} a lot to digest... The strange thing about these groups is that they correspond to very physical things. In particular, Lie groups are interesting, which are groups that can be ``generated'' continuously -- or connected continuously -- to the identity element.<br /><br />First let's define the cyclic subgroup $\langle a \rangle$, which consists of all possible powers of the group element $a$:<br /><br />\begin{eqnarray}<br />\langle a \rangle &amp;=&amp; \left[ a^{-k}, \dots, a^{-1},a^0,a^1,a^2, \dots a^n \right] \ \forall k \ \epsilon Z<br />\end{eqnarray}<br /><br />Where that Z above, is all integers. What do I mean by subgroup? I mean a subset of G -- written $S \subset G$ -- that is itself a group. (i.e. $S$ is closed under multiplication, contains inverses of all its members and the identity, and don't forget associativity). Obviously powers of $a \in S$ map to powers of $\langle a \rangle$. This cyclic subgroup thing is very useful, because if we have a cyclic subgroup $\langle S \rangle$, created by all integer powers of some subgroup of G called S, and we can create all elements in the group $G$ using $\langle S \rangle$, then we say that the elements of $S$ are the generators of the group G. Confusing enough for you?<br /><br />I guess this really means if we can build all $g \in G$ with powers of the elements of $S,e$, then those are our generators. <br /><br />Now why do we care? And why did I not care as an undergraduate?<br /><br /><br /></div>
