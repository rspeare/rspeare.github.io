Ok, so for the past two days I have been walking with a french guy named Jean who doesn´t speak any english or spanish. But somehow, we have a great time together. Some of the other pilgrims get a real kick out of us because we are always joking with hand and face gestures. Jean is from the northern part of france and is another retired adult on the camino with a wife back at home who thinks he´s crazy. I´m hoping to study some french tonight and spend some more time with Jean, he is a very nice man.<div><br /></div><div>The body is definitely adapting to walking 15 miles a day now. My feet arches have gotten stronger and the knees-joints don´t hurt nearly as much. A very interesting lesson of the camino is that you have to take your time when walking. Otherwise, you can really hurt yourself. For example, during the first two stages I treated the etapa or course as a race. Doing this, I put a lot of stress on my muscles and joints... but of course doing so was natural for a runner who is used to seeing the world pass by at a much faster pace. Today, walking slowly but consistently was much easier and my body is certainly thankful for it. </div><div><br /></div><div>It is amazing the number of different languages that I am surrounded by. There people here form all over the world, and at the dinner table last night there were at least 5 or 6 languages being thrown around. Two men from belgium are especially useful since they speak french, english, spanish, german, and dutch very well. </div><div><br /></div><div>This trip has been pretty motivating to add a third language to my brain. I have to say, it is such an incredible to be able to travel around europe and communicate with many different people. Although, in the US this hardly has any appicability. </div><div><br /></div><div>So far haven´t gotten any insults or mal treatment for being an american. Latin America was definitely a little more hostile to americans. (although I didn´t talk to any of the french while in Paris).  Many of the spanish people I´ve met have been very happy to speak spanish with me and are happy to see an American who is multilingual. There are certainly some american pilgrims who are unwilling to speak or try to speak any other language, this probably doesn´t go over well with the less touristic areas of spain.</div><div><br /></div><div>there is a lot of wine and espresso involved in the camino I am learning. Many pilgrims stop for a little espresso at a bar in small towns along the way before and after lunch. Then at dinner, a cup or even a bottle wine is served with dinner to put you to sleep. Although let me tell you! There are some snorers who will put my Uncle John to shame! I thought someone was sawing through wood above me last night. but thank god, I brought those earplugs so I was able to get about 6 hours of sleep tonight. Hopefully, no huge snorers in the albergue tonight.</div><div><br /></div><div>currently in cezar menor, I very beautiful town a little past Pampona. Many pilgrims go to visit pamplona but don´t stay there because it is a little noisy. However, there was some really cool stuff over there. Lots of music and cafes. Lots of style, fashion influence in pamplona.</div><div><br /></div><div>tomorrow I go to puenta de la reina where I think there is a bit of climb. So, I´ve got some ice on the feet, some spandex for circulation, and a good pilgrim dinner tonight should get me ready for tomorrow. </div><div><br /></div><div>first lesson of the camino= Patience. </div><div><br /></div><div>apologies if this was a little scatter brained, but using the computers in albergues is a great way for them to make money! Every 20 minutes costs 1 euro, and I´m trying to watch the pocket money, at least for now on the camino.</div><div><br /></div><div>shout out to katiepoo and megan, I thought a lot about you two today on the camino. (actually everyday). I love you very much</div>
