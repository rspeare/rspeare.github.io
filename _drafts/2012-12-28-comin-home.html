<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /><div class="p1">Bowls clank on a mottled counter top, salad spinners do their dance beneath the forearms of two quibbling cooks, it's Christmas time: arugula and parmesan, goat cheese lasagna and turkey sausage, nuts and chocolate, pound cake and ice cream, hugs and dilatory goodbyes, tired face muscles and incessant bonhomie, fatherly epigrams and fleeting motherly caresses--this is my home. Spurious compliments are exchanged between sisters with duplicitous inflection across the Kitchen. Mom is stirring like a bird, fluttering between tasks in her white turtleneck and arranging family members and food items to her liking. The world outside is hazy and grey, the roads have that thin layer of rain, almost ice, that reflects the grey sky back at you: it's a black, ominous iridescence for Holiday-sloshed drivers. I sit here during these simultaneously straining and languorous pre-dinner hours, and think of the desert.<br /><br />I have been away, in the middle east for 4 months and have acquired the traveler's sense of self-importance; the belief that I've undergone drastic changes and personal expansions. This is such a wonderful presumption to be destroyed each year, after each trip, when childhood confidants and caretakers remind you of who you truly, naturally are -- the foundations of self-concept. (Granted, this is not the same for everyone, particularly those without living family, but our genes are our identity and should they manifest in extant, living human beings, we derive a great deal of meaning from their presence and behavior.) Despite any weighty advances you may have undergone during a trip or some challenge abroad it is always a bit of a relief to slip into that old personality, the left-over habits of a younger self; like putting on an old leather coat, warm, heavy and safe. Hubris, as sweet baby Jaysus knows, is best acquired in the company of one's family, one can only be a prophet abroad. <br /><br />But this present's a problem, because, after all, Emerson (among others) states that a man can only fulfill his destiny at home. The prodigal son is the productive one. Socrates thought it craven to go abroad, because it represented a running away from one's self -- a presence that will wake with you at each hotel bedside and each misty mountaintop. "Ah yes, they say a man is made great by going abroad, well who did he take with him?â€¦ Himself!?! Then he has gained nothing." <br /><br />I disagree.</div></div>
