So. Last night at the Alegre Pub I met this man named Jim. We started talking at about 3, left the bar at 11 and met today once again to talk. This is a pretty sweet dude.<br /><br />First of all, what got us started talking was the fact that Jim and I were really the only sober people in the bar. Being sunday, there were lots of futbol (and by that I mean soccer) fans and also hollering americans raging at nfl games. We started to talk about how hard it was to be a professional athlete and how much dedication it takes. Somehow, I mentioned that I was a runner, and he sprouted up. Saying that he grew up in Spokane washington and was a year ahead of Gerry Lindgren. He trained, raced, and chilled with the great Gerry Lindgren. A few of his stories:<br /><br />While training with Gerry, Jim and about 5 other dudes would take their bag lunches in hand and run straight up a mountain. Gaining about 1000m in the process. This is absolutely incredible, especially given the altitude they were running out. After eating lunch at the top and hanging out for an hour, the guys used to run down the hill at top speed, all chasing gerry down the hill. Jim of course later learned from his coach that this wasn´t such a great idea for his training or for his knees. (downhill running when sustained can be very dangerous). Jim also told me about a park where three different school district cross country teams would meet to basically have a pissing contest midweek. Racing around the park field doing fartleks together. Spring 600meters of length along the field, and jogging the 200m width. Ouch. Jim told me about how he tried to run everyday until he was about 55 and his knees just couldn´t take it anymore. he told me about 5 o clock morning running by the washington rivers, saying "life was tough wasn´t it?".<br /><br />Listening to his stories of running and sharing in anothers passion like that really affected me. But of course our conversation continued on to other things. We began to talk about religion and physics, and I was telling about some of the really cool things about quantum physics that have actually made me a little more "out there". Jim is a practicing buddhist, his guru is actually straight off the boat from tibet and could hardly speak any english when he first arrived in the US. While I don´t agree with everything that tibetan buddhism sects have to say, it was really interesting to talk to a pretty experienced student. Apparently there are a lot of buddhist schools in colorado... who wouldve thought?<br /><br />So on to our conversation concerning religion and physics. One of my favorite stories to tell people when they ask about my "spirituality" is quantum tunneling and observation.<br /><br />In Quantum tunnelling, there is an infinitely high barrier of potential energy. In 2 dimensions this is a delta function, but in 3 dimensions think of the ultimate brick wall. Some sort of material with incredibly high density and strength, such that there isn´t even space or holes in the molecular structure for anything to pass through. But apparently, given a high energy particle like an electron, it possible for that particle to pass through the barrier. And I don´t mean slip through, I mean literally exist on one side and then suddenly exist on the other side of the barrier (like teleport). Now this is more likely with an electron because it is such a high energy particle, and it is harder to traverse very "thick" barriers. This has been mathematically proven and is a complete result of logic, yes´s and no´s 0´s and 1´s. But that means that if an electron can pass through so can an atom, a molecule, a brick, even a car. It is mathematically possible, however improbable that a car can pass through a cliff, a man can walk through water. Crazy right? But this means mathematicians should have no qualms with those who believe in miracles.<br /><br />Also, the theory of observation. And this is what Jim and I reaaallllly started to spend some time on. All matter is 99.999999999999....% space, nothingness, vaccuum. When you touch a table, it only feels hard because there are electrical interactions between your knuckles and the wood. We are not made of "stuff", we are made of tiny specs of energy, of information. Even weirder, is the fact that the quantum mechanical state of an object can be changed just by you observing it. For example, say you want to look at an electron to see whether it is spin UP or spin DOWN. Once you pick it up and look at it, you have changed its state completely. What you measure doesn´t mean a darn thing. In fact, the electron may have been in the opposite spin state before you picked up. Meaning that, before you looked at this computer screen, it might have had an entirely different quantum mechanical state, infact it might not have existed at all!<br /><br />In buddhism this problem/wierd idea is the difference between absolute reality and consensus reality. Jim was telling me some pretty crazy stuff, but basically consensus reality is what we observe and feel, as dominated by materials, dualism, etc. Absolute reality is, "what is". What the heck does that mean!?!?!?! Wish I could talk about this more, but i´m gonna have to skype chat some guru about it in colorado or tibet. Pretty cool idea though. What i love about buddhism is how much of a philosophy it is instead of a religion, with structure, rules, etc. A little about tibetan buddhism, they actually follow not the original Siddartha Guatama buddha who attained enlightenment within his lifetime, they actually follow a guy who showed up 800 years later floating on a lotus flower! An adult who is born instantly into human form as an enlightened buddha. A little more christian flavor right? And also, tibetan buddhism holds, or at least the gnigma sect holds taht each and every human being already has the capacity to learn the highest teachings, to attain the highest level of enlightenment. This ability is called having the buddha mind. Very christian as well, just like luke 17:21 "the kingdom of god is within you". The discipline of study of tibetan buddhist astounds me, I would love to travel to india one day and check it out (not to scare ya too much ma and pa).<br /><br />Alright, I think I´m gonna read a little bit, do some push ups and go watch football. A manly but intellectual night.
