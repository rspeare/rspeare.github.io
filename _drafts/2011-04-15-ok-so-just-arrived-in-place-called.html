Ok, so just arrived in a place called carrion de los condes after an interesting day of walking. Left boadillos this morning after a fantastic breakfast of eggs over easy on toast (the hospitalera treated me like her own son after seeing that I hadn´t slept well). I then proceeded to walk absent mindedly for about 2 hours into some farm fields. And, I was completely lost, off the camino. Had to turn around and go back to the canal de conde in order to find my way back to a town called fromista which should have only been an easy 5k away.<br /><br />So, I met up with two south african girls in the local bar, and they convinced me to take a bus with them to palencia and help them find their train to leon. I thought, hey waht the heck it´ll be another adventure. Ended up having a nice walk around palencia and a nice lunch near a childrens park. Then another bus to carrion, and had the energy to go for a short jog. Although, my body is definitely feeling stressed, its amazing how when you slow down and take a rest day, you can feel even more lethargic.<br /><br />But for now, things are great. Reconvened with toby julia maria and company here and we´re having a good time together now in the albergue comedor area. Toby and I got to  know each other much better tonight, I´m grateful for him having shared some very personal things and hope that I played a good listener for his thoughts. <br /><br />I am finding that just like guatemala, no extranjero comes for no reason at all. Everyone has a story, unless they are complete hiking jock who has just come here for the challenge. I´m looking forward to the walk tomorrow, given that it is supposed to be challenging and quite isolated, cuz I´ve got good company and some good music.<br /><br />On a random note, a couple of food things that I´ve come to love about spain. first of all the fruit is amazing (for the majority). Had the crispiest granny smith today,  must have squirted three others in the eye with the first bite. Second, muesli. Wow, so much like granola and you can put it in yogurt. Very refreshing after a long walk.  Also, toby and julia and maria and I have been discussing something called a maxibonn icecream sandwich, which is half ice cream sandwich have chocolate covered ice cream bar. Its like the best of both worlds. WE continually have arguments over which flavor is the best. (I personally like mint chocolate chip, maxibonn, but there are some snobbs who say magnum is a better brand). Also, figs and dates have been quite nice on hot days. Very energy rich, but like natural candy.<br /><br />Had a nice talk with julia today to about the self respect that travelling can give you. When abroad in a foreign and sometimes scary environment, travelling teaches you that you can solve problems and make decisions all on your own. A very valuable lesson for those about to enter the real world (ahem, myself). On the camino this is even more pronounced because you are travelling purely by your own physical means, house on the back, boots on the trail and all. EAch pilgrim carries a credential that allows them proof of having done the entire camino, and julia and I were joking that you should also recieve a symbol and the bottom that says "self respect". <br /><br />Its amazing how much easier tonight is than last. Perhaps it was the rest. Perhaps the company, or just some sort of rythym thats out my control. Nonetheless, for tonight life is easy on the camino. Tomorrow we will cross the half way point, and all roads lead to galicia after that.<br /><br />I´m going to make a countdown in the journal for days to fly home. As special as the trip has been and will be, it is simply not the same without family and friends. I miss you guys so much. Kate you would love julia the australian, she´s a basketball jock it seems who loves food. Meg you would love the hiking and the food, but I think the hostel situation may wear thin haha :) Clarke you would hate the walking and basically this entire trip, and it makes me laugh everyday. Ryan, you would absolutely love this. maybe we can do some hikes together in the states when I get back. Jonnie I have no idea of you´re reaction to this place, but I know you pwn everyone´s soul in the walking/toughness involved in this place. Christine you would love this place too, but its no fashion parade! Mom and Dad, I think about you every day. Dad you would want to golf on all these hills and you would love the constant movement as a filter of thought. Mom, you would love the nature out here and peace of birds singing in the morning. Joan, sometimes I imagine I´m walking with you on the beach.<br /><br />All the different sounds, smells, and sights bring me back to you guys.<br /><br />Much love from brotha rob,<br />peace out
