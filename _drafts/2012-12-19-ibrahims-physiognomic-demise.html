<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I. stopped what he was doing: his martini glass shattered on the floor, the clear liquid running over the white floor tiles and finding its way into stuccoed crevice[s], iridescent glass reflecting that unholy fluorescent light above. He staggered over to their prized 'subterranean window' lined with steel rivets, stood 3 inches from the wall -- facing it -- spread his legs shoulder-width apart, and, began bashing his brains out.&nbsp;As S. and E. weren't home (S. at a Philosophy conference in Chicago and E. out buying groceries for a weekend ratatouille) I. was unhindered in his suicidal rancor towards that poor earthen wall.<br /><br />CRACK!<br /><br />Each successive impact brought a slight crunch, a concomitant shudder in the window pane and a few popped blood vessel's in I's grief-stricken face. His eyes were bloodshot and practically bursting out of his skull with inner cerebral pressure. His forehead had a single menacing vein, which descended diagonally over the right eyebrow. His whole body was rigid and shaking with isometric effort; stabilizing, bracing itself for the next impact. His brow began to split. The blood came on first in dribbles, then in deep pulsating waves -- gushing skin-flaps leaving red ooze all over the wall. I. lost his eyesight within the first few forehead-snaps -- he was lost in a white world of pain.<br /><br />But, I. kept bashing away. Through disorientation, fatigue and terrible bodily paresthesia, he yearned for the end. It wasn't until his skull began to fracture that I. lost conscious control of his limbs and fell into a rumpled mess in a pool of his own blood. The most minute penetration had been made, connecting I's gray matter with the outside world and causing the debouchment of cerebro-spinal fluid. Slowly, sedulously, that brain batter left I's system and killed him within a matter of minutes.<br /><br />I. was free.</div>
