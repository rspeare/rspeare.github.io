So what the heck is FiOS?! As this new service becomes more and more common, people are really starting to rev up their bandwidth and the ability to pull lots of data from the internets. Is this the ultimate downstream internet connection? No way, but it's really fast and really cool, check it out:<div><br /></div><div>So FiOS is based off of a fiber-optic cable as compared to a co-axial cable. The latter is what provides digital cable. What's so special about the words "fiber optic"? Well, these cables use intensely refracted light to transmit information, as compared a simple AC signal. The highest speed cables use silica glass fibers to transmit light. These light transmitting fibers are then surrounded by a 'cladding' surface which helps to reflect and contain the light along its path. This 'cladding' surface and the low attenuation of light with in the fiber is absolutely essential to maintain a strong signal.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now for a quick tidpoint on the importance of signal strength and data transfer. When digital data is transferred through analog means, such as electromagnetic waves, the signal strength is very important because of the signal to noise ratio. The receiving computer translates analog data into digital by 'sampling' the wave at specific time intervals, and based upon the voltage/energy level, assigns a 0 or 1 to the sample time. </div>
