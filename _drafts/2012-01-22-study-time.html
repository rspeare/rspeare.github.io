Now begins the study time for my GR exam. So for general interest and the history of math/physics, Courtesy of Steven Weinberg from 'Gravitation and Cosmology', here is a little history non-euclidean geometry:<div><br /></div><div>Euclid wrote down 5 statements/postulates of  geometry, simply by looking at different figures, shapes, lines drawn on an ordinary piece of paper. As Weinberg says, many of these ideas were apparent to even the simple 20th century schoolboy and Hellenistic mathematicians in the third century B.C. One of his postulate however, stuck out because it was not so obvious to the naked eye:</div><div>"If a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines if produced indefinitely meet on that side on which the angles are less than two right angles"</div><div><br /></div><div>How freakin' confusing is THAT!? Jeeze, euclid must not have been a very sociable guy. I personally cannot make any sense of that sentence so I'll put it Legendre's terms who was struggling with the same idea in the late 1700's:</div><div>"There is a triangle in which the sum of the three angles is equal to two right angles"</div><div>AKA, sum of angles in a triangle = 180 (or pi). </div><div><br /></div><div>Okay, that makes more sense. Now this postulate is strange because its not terribly obvious when you look at a triangle and in fact, there were <i>heretics</i> back in the day who said that the sum of angles within a triangle is NOT always 180. Even Carl Friedrich Gauss joined this club in the early 1800's when he took a trip to the Hanz mountains in Germany to actually see such a triangle. If you want to see this for yourself, draw a triangle on a basketball, tennis ball, or cone. Measure all of the angles... You'll find that they sum up to more than 180! This was incredible to mathematicians in the early 1800's. They had a discovered a <i>curved</i> two dimensional space. </div><div><br /></div><div>This discovery really got Gauss going. Soon he was coming up with equations to measure the distances between points on a curved surface, separating inner 'intrinsic' properties from extrinsic properties of curved surfaces. These measurement equations are called 'metrics' and they are based off of the assumption that at any point on a curved surface, if you look at a tiny tiny tiny tiny area with a magnifying glass - it is essentially flat. For instance, take a look at a basketball. If you were a termite living on the basketball you would think that your general surroundings were perfectly flat - aka our experience on Earth and the gutsy moves of the Spanish explorers assuming that the world was NOT flat. So, if you measure a tiny displacement in this very small flat space, and continually add them up as you travel across a curved surface like the earth - you get the correct distance measurement. This is a pretty simple idea but difficult to express with numbers because it requires derivatives and infinitesimal displacements (complements of Newton). </div><div><br /></div><div>Now it wasn't until Gauss's grad student Riemman said hey, I'm going to study the curvature of N-dimensional objects. To which Gauss's reply was 'sheesh, good luck'. Riemman succeeded in coming up with this nasty thing called the Riemman Curvature tensor, which is basically a giant matrix with N to the fourth components (N being the dimensionality of the space). </div><div><br /></div><div>It wasn't until the early 1900's when Einstein picked up this Riemman curvature Tensor and applied to his earlier ideas of special relativity. He had a notion that we lived in 4 dimensional space-time. He though he could describe gravity not as a force but a curvature in our 3-dimensional space. It took him a couple years, but he brought together non-euclidean geometry, gauss and Riemman into physics to create General Relativity.</div>
