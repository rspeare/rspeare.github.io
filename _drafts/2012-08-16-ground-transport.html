<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Currently in transit to JFK international airport, I'm sitting in back of a black service car jotting down some final thoughts before leaving the country. These tan leather seats, the quiet and concentrated driver, the cool 71 degree air conditioning and the melancholy rain drops against the windshield make me contemplate the life of a politician: I wonder what is like to be a celebrity, or some species of high roller and prance around the streets of New York in a private limousine.<br /><br />The first thing I notice about this trip is an impersonal distance and coldness from the driver; I would describe it as professional solitude. Hiring a to driver take you to the airport is no <i>personal</i> comfort : he does not do this out of love or compassion, or as a friendly favor - he drives for a paycheck. This principal point of none-humanness leads to all sorts of uncomfortable consequences for the driver and the passenger. Within a larger transportation company, assignments are varied and there is no consistency in character, face, or demeanor of driver-client interaction; I can imagine that for both passenger and the driver, the opposing party becomes increasingly faceless with time, and is instead replaced with a creepy amalgamation of body-types, cell phone conversations, expensive suits, expensive luggage, and driving/sitting positions. For me, this amorphous personality seated at the opposite end of the car (depending upon where you're sitting), would be increasingly hard to engage in table conversation : I chalk it up to awkwardness or that more shameful sentiment of human apathy.<br /><br />This professional solitude, developed and amplified by repeated exposure, would be an increasing source of stress and anxiety for most "normal" citizens, unaccustomed to rpivate transport; but, there would come a time after so many private rides, stoic drivers, and plush leather interiors when the professional solitude would begin to take on a matter of fact<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
