<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Two men stand on the sidewalk. One is wearing grey slacks and a pink oxford. He's stout and stubble-bearded, sports square sunglasses and an immaculately trimmed beard. The second is wearing a fluorescent yellow mesh vest, lined with plastic orange &amp; silver stripes around the armpits and waist. The vest lies over a blue oxford, red tie and jeans. He has a clean-shaven, dark indian face.<br /><br />Both men are pointing to various aspects of a construction sight, an orange-net-enclosed area of rubble and dirt, sprent with bulldozers and cranes. They are walking slowly along the perimeter, pacing back and forth between the net and the highway. The pink man looks indignant. He shakes his hands, palms towards heaven, and traces a line of disappointment in the sand. He raises his eyebrows, faces the yellow-vested man -- who wobbles his head, back and forth, around, in chin-churning assent. The pink man puts his arms behind his back, goose steps forward, continues to choreograph shortcomings with sweeping arms, grandiloquent gesticulation. The vested man follows, points to the same things when he can, retracts his palm in defense, hand next to ear and shoulder, wrist bent, abnegating responsibility. They stand and face each other impatiently, lean in and out like hesitant sweethearts. Pointing, prodding, they stir indignation until one must move on, hands behind the back, to play cat and mouse.<br /><br />Other more sullied men in yellow vests and hard hats look on. Dust covers their boots, blue jumpsuits, and sun-spiced faces. They sit on the rubble, watching. Some squat on their haunches and watch with a dull, sleepy glare. (Some sleep in the shade). Cars slow down as they pass the pink and yellow man, executing their business ballet.<br /><br />They turn to face each other again, to play their parts: hands flying and lips fluttering, they stammer, indicate, argue with exasperation. The pink man's cherubic cheeks tremble as he raises his voice. The yellow-vested man continues to twirl his neck, tilts his head from left to right, forwards and backwards, in a vortex of compulsory cooperation. Subtle deceit lines his thin face. His cheekbones cast shadow in the midday sun, over jaw muscles clenching in aggravation. The pink man is humored: the dance goes on.<br /><br />A bull dozer drops an enormous slab of concrete, kicking up a dust plume 5 feet high. Both dancers swipe their mouths with insect-like, frantic windmill-auto-grooming. They point to the bulldozer in fury, quavering elbows &amp; fingers extended. A dark-skinned man in white pashtun dress sits cross-legged and barefoot in the pilot seat. He grins: a white lotus, calm and composed, backs the bulldozer away.<br /><br />The sun tilts at dusk, turning all the rubble yellow, then orange, then sea blue. A huddle of yellow-vested men stand with hard-hats and arms round' each others shoulders. They are pointing and tracing and giggling and laughing. Night falls and large trucks arrive to carry away the men and the rubble. Red brake lights pulse, then fade in dark distance.</div>
