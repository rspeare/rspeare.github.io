Currently in bed, in a place called tosantos about two days walk from Burgos.<br /><br />Had a fantastic day walking in the rain with francoise, a Parisian who offered to let me stay in her home. She is a retired CFO I think.<br /><br />Last night had a very interesting experience with a candian who really hates america. Let's just say I tiptoed through the dinner conversation. Today also met a Spanish man who dislikes america, but he said I "fell well with him" so everthings coo. <br /><br />Had a fantastic dinner tonight because we have a polish peregrine who is a chef staying here. It was a very awkward dinner but delicious. Spicy sausage tortillas and a nice salad. I wish I wasn't so lazy and would cook for myself more often. When done well, it is worth the time and effort. <br /><br />Looking forward to taking anoter easy day tomorrow to ages, another small village outside of Burgos. Hopefully I can have enough energy to go for a run again. Unfortunately I've only been able to run once a week due to all the walking.<br /><br />However funny story, a German man told me I was silly for walking the camino and running "cycles" later at night. He said I should just run from town to town instead if walk. Well I told him, one I don't have the money ( or the trust) to send my bags everyday. And secondly, there is a big difference between an 5mile jog and a 15 mile a day schedule. Sorry mister, we are not all crazy blue flamers like you! (he basically told me that I was being a panzee). I also met an Italian who at one point ran a marathon every weekend!!!! Holy crap. It's amazing what some people can do.<br /><br />Oh thanl god, someone finally turned out the light! Kate Speare, you are my savior or suggesting taking blinds for the flight. They have saved me many hours of sleep. Got rid of almost 7 pounds from my pack the other day by mailing h<br />To Santiago de compostela oficina de correos. What a difference! Walking feels so easy now, it's no longer hiking. There are sacrifices of course, no I only have one change of clothes, but life is simpler.<br /><br />There is a wifi hotspot at the next town so I'm hoping o upload all 70 or so photos and some videos there... Some really beautiful stuff.<br /><br />Been dreaming very intensely. I find myself thinking very often and dreaming very often of the people back home. And let me tell you, ive been doing some sleeping. Almost ten hiurs a day between siesta and a 10 o clok bedtimr. Some dreams come more often and less welcome than others, but the camino is a great opportunity to deal with things. Being isolated in nature, walking, or sleeping in some small albergue bed surrounded by snoring strangers allows easy access to mature perspective. And, there are some dreams and thoughts that feel like home and are little comforts provided in tr middle of such a strange ad quickly changing lifestyle; Clarke, we were arguing about something last night in my dream :) <br /><br />I miss you all very much. Especially you tonight (and last night)  Kate. I brought a baby picture of the two of us and it's been a great reminder of my other half.<br /><br />Peace out!
