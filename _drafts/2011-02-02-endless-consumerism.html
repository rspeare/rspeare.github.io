I am on Ryan fink's couch right now. It is quite comfortable, Ryan has got some very comfortable looking basketball shorts on. Watching special victims unit... life is good. <br /><br />But oh god, one thing that bothers me are all the commercials and advertisements for weightloss these days: body by jake, zumba fitness, etc. It's a tough thing to watch so repeatedly. Commercials for very large Hamburgers and fried food, and then commercials for excercise programs. Must we americans just be uber-consumers who spend all our time eating, buying, consuming goods, and then working it all off in the gym and at the office? Ugh, what an endless cycle.
