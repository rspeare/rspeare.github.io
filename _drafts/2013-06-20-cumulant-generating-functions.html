Ok, just because I haven't posted in a while, I'd like to write down some cool stuff I've learned recently.<br /><br />By working with Spectra and 2 point, 3point, 4point correlation functions etc., I've been studying up BIG time on convolution and the fourier transformation, cumulant and moment generating functions, blah blah blah. But here are two revelations from this morning (feel free to google it):<br /><br />(1) Cumulants -- not moments -- are additive under convolution. This can be proved by the additive nature of a cumulant generating function -- since it's log(P(k)) -- or by explicitly by adding up the moments of two convolved functions. This is way way cool. The variance, or the standard deviation as most people understand it, is additive under convolution. So if we combine to statistical distributions, their total dispersion will add; so will their skewness, and their kurtosis.<br /><br />This is very important for the central limit theorem, because convolution also increases the degree to which a Probability density function -- a PDF -- can be differentiated. So the final distribution becomes smoother and more dispersed. I'm still figuring out why the second cumulant/moment becomes the most important characteristic of the distribution -- since that is the salient feature of a gaussian. (The Central limit theorem says that a ton of convolved PDF's will approach a gaussian; meaning the only non zero cumulant or moment will be the second one, the variance.)<br /><br />(2) Moments in arbitrary dimensions are actually Tensors. This blew my mind. The first moment of a 3D distribution is a 3D tensor; which, makes sense since there is a mean x,y and z. But that means that the second moment is a matrix, and that the off diagonal elements represent anisotropy. I would like to get further into this and figure out how cumulants relate to the off-diagonal elements of these moment tensors....<br /><br />That was gross regurgitation, but I had to put into words.<br /><br />
