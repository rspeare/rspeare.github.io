<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Whitman fountain looms to the right, pattering and supposedly brilliant, its light stifled by airborne goop. Its glare hardly makes it past the courtyard. Pining, hand outstretched, it gasps and faints on its way down the steps, a strange smile on its lips as apoxia sets in -- hallucinating better times with naked, bathing toddlers and icy clear skies and pennies and outdoor lunches, oh, those were the days… -- a luminous corpse next to Prospect. Well, you're no help to ol' Sloth. Friggin' fountain lamp. Focus on the footsies, he says to himself; leans forward, over the knees, bending precipitously at the hips and curving the spine inward, ever inward until his nose is practically touching those cute toes, covered in madras fabric from mama, the white (bunny-tied) shoelaces tickling his nostrils with each step: one-two-one-two-one-two-one-two-one-creak-eek-creak-eek… Slothrob uncurls himself and opens his eyes as wide as possible -- the pupils not necessarily following suit -- collecting light from far ahead. Washington road is marked by a green dot, a streetlight, a tiny hole in oblivion.<br /><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">A black summer haze fills the sky. Its dark solute chokes the moon; makes it difficult to see five feet in front of you. Cars are parked along Prospect avenue. They float backwards, bobbing in vespertinal grime. Like snow this air covers and silences. No stumbling undergraduates this evening. No beer-sodden oxfords or polos or blazers or tommy-bahama shorts -- or those infamous fermented &amp; festering Sperry's -- stuck to bleary-eyed boys, damp and oblivious to their gooseflesh. No tittering packs of girls. No bent or broken stilettos, flexed beyond repair under vertiginous hoydens, twirling and giggling above. No chest-beating roars from homebound dissolutes. No bare-footed zombies walking at 3am in search of carbohydrates and a bed. Just sticky hot silence.<br /><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">A blue light floats above campus. It struggles to pierce the air; disperses into a spray-paint halo. It's Slothrob's only sense of direction. He's sweaty and tired of walking. Looks down at his shoes stepping one-two-one-two-one-two-one-two on the pavement, which, is hardly visible. 'What the hell?' It's like tar was poured into the atmosphere -- warm and thick and hurts a little bit on the way down. Better not breathe too much there Slothrob, might make ya' sick. That's called miasmatism. Just keep walkin' dawg'. You can hold your breathe til' you get to campus. Make it to Marx and that cool blue light will clear this stuff. Yeah.<br /><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Suddenly the cars seem to stretch away, the road getting wider and wider, four lines towards one-point perspective serving as a laminar flow of objects, like four black holes, pulling and perturbing those car hoods until they've streamlined entirely into the convergent distance. 'Oh God.', checking behind now for some massive eighteen-wheeler with a grill three miles wide, barrelling towards him, just a giant, iridescent wall of metal and engine and wheels. He sees a glint in the darkness -- he thinks -- but who's to say there's a sound. Who's there.? Suddenly a rush of air and a rumbling in the pavement lets Slothrob know that yes, the ol' truck is passing overhead now, straddling him towards Washington road, only to stop at the enormous streetlight and perhaps rest. A meaty exhaust from the truck must be swirling towards him: he feels a flatulent breeze strike his face. 'Ugh, gosh this is awful'. He stops walking forward and the air calms again.<br /><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">But now that he's still the sidewalks of Prospect avenue begin to return, unknotting themselves from the one-point singularity they entered before, streaming out along the same four lines, creating a queasy feeling in Slothrob's stomach. He's about to vomit when there's a retching behind him, an evil canine cough; then a gurgling. Glottal smacks echo off the sides of Prospect avenue, which are now accelerating inwards, collapsing in a space (T_ii) curvature rush. Slothrob senses a pair of eyes: a rabid coyote or dog of some sort. The gurgling again, but faster: clicking and meaty slaps of tongue and tonsil and god knows what else (jeeze, it sounds wet in there) hitting his face, making his cheeks tremble in fear. The jittering in those craven jowls spreads to the hands and Slothrob's spine goes stiff. He thinks to turn around, imagining a giant cat with two heads, maybe a few tentacles, some oozing cerberus waiting for him, but as he turns it lunges and horrible features emerge from the darkness.<br /><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Two gaping eyes, closely spaced over an equine snout, stretched to full size in murderous excitement, wrinkles gathered in crows feet from lecherous joy. Two huge nostrils and a smile. A psychotic smile.<br /><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Slothrob realises he's going to die at the hands of this face puncturing the darkness and screams. He screams himself awake, sitting up in bed, eyes wide open: 'NoOOOOoooOOOo'. Ceiling. Almost pisses the bed by his own decibel level.<br /><br /></div><div style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Afterwards, one can't help but laugh.</div><div><br /></div></div>
