Holy crap. Today's walk was very hard. Although I have to admit, It is self inflicted pain. Just like the firs stage to roncessvalles, I took the inclination as some sort of personal challenge to my masculinity and therefore attempted to sprint up the mountain. Toby and I were laughing about this tonight, saying that it's a natural male thing. Had a nice day though, had some good coffee an wifi at a beautiful bar as well as a nice walk around town with Toby and our new German friend Benny. Benny works at a really high brow hotel so es always talking about strange fruits and crazy hotels
