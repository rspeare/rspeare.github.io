<br/><br /><h1> my first post in pure HTML </h1><br /><br /><p><br /><br />My first paragraph in HTML.  Hahahahhahahah. So, to explain it is actually impossible to post on blogspot from an iPhone... But I am doing it right now! How you ask? I have been studying HTML code and so can now design website pages without using standard input methods of blogging websites! Lol sweet duuuude.<br /><p/><br /><br/><br /><p><br />so now for today's rant. Life has been good here in xela working on more complex tenses in speech and really trying to push my limits of comprehension. However, it has been disconcerting to read about wikileaks recently. More later, wifi sux here<br /><>
