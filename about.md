Physicist turned Software Engineer and Statistician -- I try to use Machine Learning in clever, simple ways to impact the world around me. Currently working as a Deployment Strategist at Palantir -- an incredible experience & opportunity. Before joining Palantir I studied the Cosmological Bispectrum (or three-point correlation function) with [Roman Scoccimarro](http://cosmo.nyu.edu/roman/) and Genus topology with [Richard Gott](http://web.astro.princeton.edu/people/j-richard-gott-iii). Both topics -- and advisors -- have strong ties to Gaussian Random Fields and continue to pierce almost every problem I see.

I am actively looking for pro-bono work, projects that use numbers and software to positively impact the world. If you are looking for a flexible and personable quant, email me at: robert DOT speare AT gmail DOT com. 

You can see old math-related-thoughts on my [old blog](http://www.rspeare.blogspot.com).
